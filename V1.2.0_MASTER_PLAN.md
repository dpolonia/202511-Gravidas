# Gravidas Pipeline v1.2.0 - Master Implementation Plan
## Plan B: Operations/Cost Optimization Research

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Target Release:** March 2026 (12 weeks)
**Total Budget:** €5,100
**Total Effort:** 232 hours

---

## 📋 Document Index

This master plan references three key documents:

1. **V1.2.0_ROADMAP.md** - High-level strategic roadmap
2. **V1.2.0_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed Phase 1 implementation (Critical Fixes)
3. **V1.2.0_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_PART2.md** - Phases 2-4 implementation

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

### The Strategic Pivot

**FROM** (v1.1.0 - Problematic):
- ❌ "Prove synthetic interviews replace real interviews"
- ❌ "Obtain same results as real interviews"
- ❌ Clinical validation without baseline data

**TO** (v1.2.0 - Honest & Achievable):
- ✅ "Cost-optimized framework for synthetic healthcare interview generation"
- ✅ "89% cost reduction through multi-provider AI orchestration"
- ✅ "Operations research contribution to AI service procurement"
- ✅ "Training data generation for healthcare NLP"

### Why This Pivot is Critical

1. **Scientific Integrity** - Current claims are unprovable without real interview comparison data
2. **Publication Success** - Reviewers will reject overclaimed research
3. **Long-term Credibility** - Honest framing builds foundation for future validation
4. **Achievable Timeline** - Can be completed in 12 weeks vs. 6-12 months for real validation

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

**1. Semantic Tree Generation Fix (Task 1.1)**
- **Risk:** May require deep debugging, complex FHIR parsing issues
- **Impact:** Blocks all semantic matching functionality
- **Mitigation:**
  - Allocate 2-week buffer (already in plan)
  - Fallback plan: Use demographic-only matching if semantic fails
  - Document exact failure modes early
- **Go/No-Go Decision:** End of Week 2
  - If <80% success rate, escalate and consider fallback

**2. FHIR Data Extraction (Task 1.2)**
- **Risk:** Synthea may not generate required Observation resources
- **Impact:** Can't extract vitals, reduces interview realism
- **Mitigation:**
  - Review Synthea config early (Week 2, Wednesday)
  - If needed, re-run Synthea with pregnancy module fully enabled
  - Document which vitals are available vs. missing
  - Set realistic expectations (aim for 90%, accept 80%)
- **Go/No-Go Decision:** End of Week 2
  - If <70% completeness, document limitations in manuscript

**3. Clinical Protocol Validation (Task 2.1)**
- **Risk:** Finding domain experts for review may be difficult/slow
- **Impact:** Protocols may not be clinically appropriate
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start recruiting reviewers in Week 4 (before protocols finalized)
  - Use Claude Code to generate high-quality first drafts
  - Leverage existing professional networks
  - If can't find reviewers: clearly mark protocols as "pending clinical validation"
- **Contingency:** Release with "preliminary" status, validate in v1.2.1

**4. Manuscript Acceptance (Task 3.3)**
- **Risk:** IJPE reviewers may still be skeptical even with honest framing
- **Impact:** Publication delayed or rejected
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strong operations focus (IJPE's core scope)
  - Emphasize novel cost-optimization framework
  - Include sensitivity analysis and decision framework
  - Clear limitations section showing self-awareness
  - Consider alternative journals if rejected
- **Alternative Journals:**
  - Operations Research (top-tier OR journal)
  - Production and Operations Management
  - Decision Support Systems
  - Health Care Management Science

### Medium-Risk Items

**5. Test Coverage Target (Task 1.4)**
- **Risk:** 60% coverage may be time-consuming, hard to reach
- **Impact:** Code quality lower, harder to maintain
- **Mitigation:**
  - Focus on critical path code first (semantic tree, FHIR parser, matching)
  - Accept lower coverage (50%) if needed, document decision
  - Prioritize functional tests over coverage percentage
- **Minimum Acceptable:** 50% coverage on core modules

**6. 100-Interview Validation (Task 4.1)**
- **Risk:** Large test may reveal new bugs or quality issues
- **Impact:** May need additional debugging time
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run smaller tests throughout (10, 25, 50) to catch issues early
  - Budget 1 week buffer for bug fixes
  - Validate incrementally by protocol
- **Success Threshold:** ≥90% success rate (95% is goal)
