I have a high school diploma, but I haven't pursued any further education yet. My job keeps me pretty busy, but it's mostly desk work, so I tend to be pretty sedentary. I'm currently single, and my income is lower-middle, which makes it hard to afford some things, especially healthcare. I don't have the best insurance, and that limits my access to medical services. A couple of years ago, I had a miscarriage, which was really tough for me, and since then, I haven't been planning on getting pregnant again. I do use condoms for contraception, but I haven\u2019t always been consistent with it. Overall, I'm just trying to manage my health and navigate life as best as I can.",

I remember feeling excited at first, but then I started to feel overwhelmed with everything that was happening. I didn't have a lot of support or information about what to expect during pregnancy, which made it a little scary. Unfortunately, I ended up having a miscarriage a few weeks later. It was really hard for me emotionally\u2014something I hadn't anticipated. Since then, I've been hesitant to think about getting pregnant again, especially since I feel like I don't have the resources or support I would need if I were to go through that again.

Looking back, I wish I had reached out for guidance or even just someone to talk to.

Sometimes the staff is helpful, but other times, I feel rushed or like I'm just another number. I really wish I could find someone who I could trust and who would take the time to listen to my concerns. It\u2019s hard to build a relationship with a provider when you don't see them regularly, especially since I tend to avoid medical visits due to my insurance situation.

I know that during pregnancy, there are usually several check-ups to track the baby's development and my health. I would expect things like routine blood tests, ultrasounds, and discussions about nutrition and lifestyle changes.

But I haven't spoken to a healthcare provider about it yet, mainly because of my insurance situation and limited access to care. I feel like I should probably be more proactive about my health, especially with everything that's been going on, but it's hard to know where to start.

I didn\u2019t prioritize fruits and vegetables as much as I should have. \n\nIf I were to get pregnant again, I would want to focus more on eating a balanced diet with plenty of nutrients to support a healthy pregnancy. I\u2019ve heard that things like folic acid are crucial, but I\u2019m not sure how to incorporate that into my meals.
