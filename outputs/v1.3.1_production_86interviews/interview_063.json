I\u2019ve been a stay-at-home mom for quite a while now, and honestly, it keeps me busy! I have a high school diploma, and while I\u2019ve thought about going back to school, it\u2019s hard to find the time with everything going on at home. We live on a middle-income budget, which can be challenging sometimes, especially when it comes to healthcare access. I have Medicaid, which helps, but I still find it difficult to get to appointments. My lifestyle is pretty sedentary, and I smoke occasionally, which I know isn\u2019t great for my health. Overall, I'm not planning on having more children since I have four already, but I want to make sure I'm taking care of myself and my family. How about you? What else would you like to know?",

      "text": "Of course! I first learned I was pregnant with my oldest child about 20 years ago. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety, as it was such a big change in my life. Over the years, I had three more pregnancies, all of which were vaginal deliveries. Each time was a bit different, but I generally had the usual symptoms like morning sickness and fatigue. I tried to take care of myself as best as I could, but I didn\u2019t always have the best support or access to healthcare during those times. \n\nI have to admit, I didn\u2019t have regular prenatal care for all my pregnancies. Sometimes it was hard to get to the clinic, especially with the kids at home, and I didn\u2019t always feel like I could ask for help. My husband worked a lot, so it fell on me to manage everything, including the appointments. I think that might have contributed to some challenges I faced, like the anemia I was diagnosed with after my last pregnancy. \n\nWould you like to know more about any specific pregnancies or experiences during that time?",

The clinic I went to was about a half-hour away, and getting there with my schedule was tough, especially with my husband working and the other kids at home. \n\nThe experience itself was a bit mixed. The staff were generally nice, but I didn\u2019t feel like I had enough time to ask all the questions I had. I remember feeling nervous during the appointments and wishing I could have someone with me for support. It felt like a lot of information to take in, and I often left feeling unsure if I was doing everything right. \n\nFor my other pregnancies, I didn\u2019t always go as early or as regularly as I should have. Sometimes I\u2019d miss appointments because of child care issues or just feeling too exhausted. Looking back, I can see how that might have affected my health and the health of my babies. I wish I had known more about the importance of regular check-ups and how to advocate for myself when it came to my care. \n\nDid you want to know more about how my access to care changed with each pregnancy or anything else?",

The providers there were usually nurse practitioners or midwives, and while they were kind, I didn\u2019t always feel a strong connection with any one of them. It was often different faces each time I went in, which made it hard to build a trusting relationship. \n\nI remember feeling like I was just another patient in the system, and sometimes I felt rushed during my appointments. I would try to ask questions, but it often felt like they were on a tight schedule, so I didn\u2019t always get the thorough answers I needed. I think that made me hesitant to bring up some of my concerns, especially since I was juggling so much at home.\n\nI did appreciate that they offered some educational resources, but I often wished I had someone who could sit down with me and really go over everything in detail.

For my first pregnancy, I think I was supposed to go in every four weeks initially, but as my pregnancies progressed, it became more frequent\u2014maybe every two weeks or once a week in the later stages. However, I found it challenging to keep up with that schedule consistently. \n\nA typical visit usually started with me checking in at the front desk and then waiting in the exam room for a nurse or provider to come in. They would usually ask me a few questions about how I was feeling, check my weight, and take my blood pressure. Then, they would listen to the baby's heartbeat, which was always a relief to hear. \n\nI remember there being a lot of information shared quickly\u2014like what tests I needed and what to expect in the coming weeks. Sometimes, they would hand me pamphlets or printouts, but honestly, it felt overwhelming to process everything in that short time. I often had questions about things like nutrition, exercise, and any symptoms I was experiencing, but by the time I thought to ask, it felt like the appointment was already wrapping up. \n\nI wish I had more time to discuss my worries or any specific health concerns I had, especially since I was dealing with things like anemia. It was frustrating to feel like I had to manage everything on my own without a clear understanding of my health needs. \n\nWould you like to know more about the specific challenges I faced during these visits or anything else related to my appointment experiences?",

I remember feeling extremely fatigued, and it was tough to keep up with everything at home while also taking care of a newborn. I didn\u2019t realize how serious anemia could be at the time, and I wish I had understood the signs and symptoms better.\n\nAdditionally, during some of my pregnancies, I dealt with gestational diabetes for a brief period, which was a bit scary. I had to monitor my diet more closely, and that added another layer of stress to an already busy time. I didn\u2019t have a lot of support or guidance on how to manage it, which made it difficult to navigate.\n\nThere were also times when I felt like I wasn\u2019t gaining enough weight or that my weight was a concern\u2014especially since I\u2019ve struggled with obesity. I know that can affect pregnancy, but I didn\u2019t always feel like I had the right information or support to help me manage my health. \n\nOverall, I think those health concerns impacted my pregnancies and my ability to enjoy that time as much as I could have. I often worried about how my health would affect my babies and if I was doing everything I needed to do for them. \n\nIs there anything specific you\u2019d like to know about my health concerns, or would you like me to share more about how I managed those issues?",

I often forget to take them or don\u2019t prioritize it, especially with everything else going on at home.\n\nI also try to eat a balanced diet, but with my busy schedule, I sometimes rely on quick meals that might not be the healthiest. I know there are certain foods that can help with my anemia, like leafy greens and beans, but it can be hard to make those a regular part of my diet. \n\nI haven\u2019t been prescribed anything for my prediabetes, but I\u2019m aware that I need to be careful about my sugar intake and try to incorporate some healthier choices into my meals. \n\nDo you want to know more about my dietary habits or anything else related to the medications and supplements I take?",

I tried to eat healthily, but with so much going on\u2014taking care of the kids, managing the household\u2014it was often challenging to prioritize my own nutrition. \n\nIn the early stages of my pregnancies, I had a lot of cravings, which sometimes led me to indulge in things I probably shouldn't have. I remember craving things like ice cream and snacks that weren't the healthiest. I did try to eat fruits and veggies, but honestly, I often ended up relying on quick meals or convenience foods because cooking while managing everything else was tough. \n\nI was aware that I needed to focus on getting enough nutrients, especially with my anemia. I tried to incorporate foods rich in iron, like red meat and beans, but some days it just didn\u2019t happen. I also know that I should\u2019ve paid more attention to my carbohydrate intake, especially when I had gestational diabetes. But I felt overwhelmed trying to balance everything, and I didn\u2019t have a lot of guidance on how to manage my diet effectively during that time.\n\nLooking back, I really wish I had more support or resources to help me understand what I should be eating and how to make better choices. It\u2019s something I still struggle with now, trying to maintain a healthy diet while managing my busy life.\n\nWould you like to know more about my specific dietary habits during my pregnancies, or how I\u2019ve tried to improve my nutrition since then?",

There were definitely moments of joy and excitement, especially when I felt the baby moving or heard the heartbeat for the first time. Those were really special moments that I cherished. However, I also experienced a lot of anxiety and stress throughout my pregnancies.\n\nWith each pregnancy, I found myself worrying about my health and the health of my babies. Given my struggles with anemia and gestational diabetes, I was always concerned about whether I was doing enough to ensure a healthy pregnancy. Sometimes, I felt overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for my other children while also preparing for a new baby. I often put a lot of pressure on myself to be a good mom and to manage everything perfectly, which only added to my stress.\n\nI also faced feelings of isolation at times. Living in a rural area made it harder to connect with other moms or find support groups. I often felt like I was going through it alone, especially when I had questions or concerns that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable bringing up during my appointments. I wished I had someone to talk to who understood what I was going through.\n\nLooking back, I think that emotional support is just as important as physical health during pregnancy.

He worked a lot, which meant he was often away during the day, so I had to handle a lot of things on my own. He was always there for me when he could be, and I appreciated his presence during the important moments, like when I had ultrasounds or went into labor. However, because of his work schedule, he sometimes couldn\u2019t attend all the appointments or be as involved as I would have liked.\n\nI also had my children to think about, and while they were excited about the new baby, they were still young and needed a lot of my attention. This often made it hard for me to find time for myself or to seek out additional support.\n\nIn terms of extended family and friends, I didn\u2019t have a strong support network nearby. Most of my family lives quite a distance away, and while I did have a few friends, they were also busy with their own lives and families. I sometimes felt isolated, especially when I needed someone to talk to about my worries or experiences. \n\nI really wished I had access to a support group or a community of other moms who could relate to what I was going through. I think having that kind of network would have made a significant difference in how I felt emotionally during my pregnancies. \n\nDo you want to know more about how I tried to seek support or any specific instances where I felt particularly supported or unsupported?",

My preference was always for a vaginal delivery since that was how I had delivered my other children. I felt more comfortable with that process, and I appreciated the idea of a more natural delivery.\n\nI also wanted to have as little intervention as possible, but I found that things don\u2019t always go as planned. For instance, during my last pregnancy, I had some concerns about my anemia and how it might affect my ability to handle labor. So, while I wanted to stick to my preferences, I was also aware that I might need to be open to different options if complications arose.\n\nI usually discussed my preferences with the healthcare providers, but I sometimes felt like those conversations were brief and didn\u2019t cover everything I wanted to address. I wished I had more time to express my thoughts and concerns, especially since I was nervous about the delivery process each time. \n\nI also thought about having someone with me for support during labor, but I often felt like it would just be my husband. I think I would have benefited from having a doula or a close friend there to help advocate for me and keep me calm. \n\nOverall, while I had preferences, I learned to be adaptable, knowing that the most important thing was a safe delivery for my baby and me. \n\nIs there anything specific you\u2019d like to know about my birth plans, or perhaps how my experiences influenced my preferences over time?",

I would search for articles and forums about pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. There were times I found helpful tips or reassuring stories from other moms, but I also encountered a lot of conflicting information, which made it tough to know what to believe. It was overwhelming at times, especially when I was trying to figure out what was best for my health and my babies.\n\nBooks were another resource I used. I picked up a few pregnancy books that provided insights into each trimester and what to expect during childbirth. They helped me feel more informed, but I still felt like I needed more personalized guidance.\n\nDespite these sources, I often wished I had a trusted mentor or someone with experience who could guide me through the process.

Since we live on a middle-income budget and I have Medicaid coverage, I\u2019ve relied on that for most of my prenatal care. It helps with the costs of doctor visits and any necessary tests, but there are still other expenses that add up quickly.\n\nFor instance, while my prenatal care is covered, I\u2019ve had to think about other costs, like maternity clothes and baby supplies. I try to budget for those things, but it can be challenging to set aside money when we have other bills to pay. I usually look for sales or second-hand items to save money, especially since we\u2019ve been through this before and know what we really need for the baby.\n\nI also worry about the costs of delivery, although I know Medicaid covers a lot of it. There\u2019s always that uncertainty about what might happen during labor and if there will be any additional costs if complications arise. It adds a layer of stress, knowing that unexpected expenses can come up.\n\nWe\u2019ve also had discussions about how to prepare for the baby\u2019s arrival, like whether we need to set up a separate room or just make space in our existing setup. With four kids already, we have a lot of supplies, but I still find myself second-guessing what we might need or if we should buy anything new.\n\nOverall, I\u2019ve learned to be resourceful and to prioritize what\u2019s most important. I often find myself balancing our financial situation with the desire to provide everything we can for our newest family member, and it can be a bit overwhelming.\n\nIs there anything specific you\u2019d like to know about how I manage these financial aspects, or perhaps how I\u2019ve prepared for previous pregnancies in terms of budgeting?",
