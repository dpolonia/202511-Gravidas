I live in a rural area of Kentucky, and I come from a lower-middle-income family. It can be tough sometimes, especially managing finances and schoolwork. I\u2019m single and not really planning to get pregnant right now. My lifestyle is moderately healthy \u2013 I try to eat well and stay active, but I do have a lot of stress from school and financial concerns. \n\nI\u2019ve had a few health issues recently, like some lacerations from minor injuries and a sore throat that turned out to be a viral infection. I haven\u2019t been able to see a doctor yet because I don\u2019t have insurance, which makes it harder to access healthcare when I need it. ",

Since I'm not planning a pregnancy right now, I haven't really thought about prenatal care or anything like that.

It's just hard to think about when I don't have insurance and I'm already dealing with a lot of stress from school and finances. \n\nInterviewer: I understand, that sounds really challenging.

However, I can imagine that if I were to get pregnant, I would need access to a healthcare provider who could guide me through the process. I'd want information on nutrition, prenatal vitamins, and regular check-ups to ensure both my health and the baby's health. \n\nI think having someone to talk to about my concerns and questions would be really important, especially since I feel overwhelmed with everything going on in my life right now. Access to affordable care would also be crucial, as I know that costs can add up quickly. It feels a bit daunting to think about all of that without insurance or a strong support system. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Olivia. It\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed. You mentioned wanting access to affordable care and support. Can you describe any specific resources or types of support you think could be helpful, both in terms of healthcare and emotional support?",

However, if I were to get pregnant, I would hope to find a provider who is understanding and supportive. I think it's really important to have a good relationship with a healthcare provider, someone who listens to my concerns and answers my questions without judgment. \n\nIn terms of resources, I think community health clinics could be really helpful, especially if they offer sliding scale fees for those of us without insurance. Online resources or support groups could also provide valuable information and emotional support. Having access to a counselor or therapist would be great too, especially for managing stress and anxiety related to pregnancy or just life in general. I really believe that having the right support system in place would make a huge difference. \n\nInterviewer: That makes a lot of sense, Olivia.

But if I were to get pregnant, I imagine I would want to have regular check-ups, maybe once a month in the beginning, and then more frequently as the pregnancy progressed. \n\nI think a typical visit would involve checking my weight, blood pressure, and possibly getting some blood tests to monitor my health and the baby's health. I would hope that during those visits, the healthcare provider would talk to me about any symptoms I might be experiencing, discuss my nutrition, and answer any questions I have. \n\nIt would be important for me to feel comfortable asking about any concerns, like stress or financial pressures, and how they might affect my pregnancy. I guess I would want those visits to feel supportive rather than just clinical. But again, since I don\u2019t have experience with this yet, I can only imagine what it would be like. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that perspective, Olivia. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019d want those visits to be supportive and informative. Can you tell me about any experiences you've had with healthcare in the past, even if they are unrelated to pregnancy? How did those experiences shape your views on seeking care?",

However, I do have some health issues like lacerations from minor injuries and a recent bout of viral pharyngitis that I mentioned earlier. \n\nThese experiences have made me more aware of how important it is to have access to healthcare. When I\u2019ve needed care for those issues, it\u2019s been difficult without insurance, and I've often had to rely on home remedies or wait until my symptoms worsen before seeking help. This has made me realize how crucial it is to have a supportive healthcare system in place, especially for someone who might be going through pregnancy-related challenges. \n\nIf I were to become pregnant, I would be really concerned about managing any complications that could arise without easy access to medical care. I think that\u2019s part of why I feel so apprehensive about the idea of pregnancy right now \u2013 the thought of not having the necessary support makes it seem even more daunting. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s really insightful, Olivia. It sounds like your past experiences have had a significant impact on your feelings about healthcare. If you did find yourself in a situation where you were experiencing complications during a pregnancy, what do you think your first steps would be in seeking help?",

I did have that viral throat infection recently, and I just managed it with some throat lozenges and plenty of fluids. \n\nAs for supplements, I haven\u2019t been taking any vitamins or anything like that, but I know that if I were to get pregnant, I would want to start taking prenatal vitamins, especially folic acid, to support a healthy pregnancy. However, since I don't have insurance, I haven't been able to afford those kinds of supplements yet. It\u2019s something I would definitely prioritize if I were to become pregnant, but right now, I\u2019m just trying to manage my general health as best as I can with the resources I have. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Olivia.

I\u2019ve learned that getting enough nutrients like folic acid, iron, and calcium is crucial for the baby\u2019s development. \n\nRight now, I try to eat moderately healthy, but it can be challenging on a tight budget. I often rely on whatever is affordable, and sometimes I don't get enough of the nutrients I need. If I were to become pregnant, I think I would need guidance on meal planning or access to affordable healthy food options. It might also help to have resources that provide recipes and tips for eating healthy on a budget. \n\nAdditionally, I believe that having support from a healthcare provider or a nutritionist would be beneficial to help me understand my dietary needs during pregnancy and how to make healthy choices that are accessible given my financial situation.",

I might worry about how I would manage my studies and responsibilities while preparing for a baby. Anxiety about financial stability and access to healthcare would probably weigh heavily on me as well. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that pregnancy can bring a lot of changes, both physically and emotionally, and I can see how that could be challenging. I would want to be in a place where I could talk about my feelings and concerns openly, whether that\u2019s with friends, family, or a counselor. Having that emotional support would be really important for me to navigate the ups and downs of pregnancy. \n\nIf I had a good healthcare provider, I would hope they could also support me emotionally and help me find resources for mental health, especially if I started feeling overwhelmed or anxious. It\u2019s a lot to think about, but I understand that having a support system in place can make a big difference. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on that, Olivia.

They try to encourage me to focus on my studies and remind me that I can always talk to them about anything that\u2019s bothering me. \n\nI also have a close group of friends at college who I confide in. We share our experiences and help each other navigate the stress of school and life. I think if I were to become pregnant, I would lean on them even more, as they could offer a listening ear and support during a really big life change. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about joining a support group, especially for young women or students who might be going through similar situations. That could be a good way to connect with others who understand the challenges I might face. Having a solid support network would be essential for me, especially during a time that could bring so many changes and emotions. \n\nInterviewer: That sounds like a great support system you have in place, Olivia.

But I would also want to feel comfortable with the staff and know that they would listen to my preferences and concerns during labor. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s important to discuss a birth plan with a healthcare provider, so I would want to have those conversations early on. I might also consider talking to friends who have had babies to hear about their experiences and get their advice. Ultimately, I would want to feel informed and empowered to make the best decisions for myself and my baby during that time. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s a thoughtful approach, Olivia.

I find resources from reputable health organizations to be really helpful, as they often provide evidence-based information.\n\nI also pay attention to discussions among my friends, especially those who are more knowledgeable or have had experiences with pregnancy. They often share their insights and tips, which can be really informative. Social media can be a mixed bag, but I\u2019ve found some accounts that focus on maternal health and provide valuable information.\n\nIf I were to become pregnant, I would definitely want to seek out books or guides specifically focused on pregnancy and childbirth to gain a better understanding of what to expect. I think having a variety of sources would help me feel more prepared and informed.
