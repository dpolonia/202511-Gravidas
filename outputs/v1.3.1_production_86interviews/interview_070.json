My family comes from a lower-middle-income background, so finances can be stressful, especially with tuition and living expenses. I\u2019m currently single and trying to focus on my studies, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed with the academic pressure and financial stress. I have access to Medicaid, but it's still challenging to get the healthcare I need, and I haven't had any medical encounters recently despite having some health issues. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Charlotte.

I do have some pregnancy-related conditions that I was told about during a routine check-up, but I haven\u2019t experienced a pregnancy myself. It\u2019s something I think about from time to time, especially with my current situation\u2014being in college and financially stressed, I don't feel ready for that kind of responsibility. I use condoms for contraception to make sure I stay on track with my studies and life goals. \n\nInterviewer: I understand, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re being proactive about your contraceptive choices. Can you tell me about your experiences with accessing healthcare, especially regarding your pregnancy-related conditions? Have you had any challenges or successes in getting the care you need?",

However, during my check-up for some other health issues, the doctor mentioned pregnancy-related conditions that I should be aware of, which was a bit surprising for me. I think they were more about general health advice and being informed about what to watch for in case I do decide to get pregnant in the future. \n\nAccessing healthcare has been pretty challenging for me overall. Living in a rural area, there aren't many clinics nearby, and sometimes it feels like I have to jump through hoops to get an appointment, especially with my Medicaid coverage. I often have to wait a long time to see a doctor, and when I do go, I don't always feel like I have enough time to discuss everything I want to. I think it\u2019s hard for someone in my situation to get the right information and care without feeling rushed or unsupported.\n\nInterviewer: That sounds like a frustrating experience, Charlotte. It\u2019s important to feel supported when navigating healthcare. Given the challenges you've mentioned, have you found any particular resources or support systems that have helped you with your health or navigating the healthcare system?",

My experiences have mostly been with a general practitioner for other health issues, like my ear infections and throat problems. I wouldn\u2019t say I have a strong relationship with my doctor; it\u2019s more of a transactional experience. When I go in, we discuss my symptoms, and I get my prescriptions, but I often feel rushed. Sometimes, I wish I could have a more personal connection where I could ask more questions or discuss my concerns about my health and future. \n\nI\u2019ve looked into local clinics, but they often have limited hours or aren\u2019t accepting new patients, so I end up feeling a bit lost. I think it would be really beneficial to have a provider who could give me more tailored advice, especially about my health and any potential pregnancy-related issues. \n\nInterviewer: That makes sense, Charlotte. Building a trusting relationship with a healthcare provider can really make a difference.

However, I've read a bit about what those appointments usually involve, like checking for the baby's health, discussing nutrition, and monitoring the mother\u2019s health. I imagine it would be a lot more in-depth than my regular visits for other health issues.\n\nIf I were to become pregnant and start having those appointments, I would want to discuss things like how to manage my stress with school and finances, what healthy lifestyle changes I could make, and any potential risks I should be aware of given my background. I also think it would be really important to talk about what resources are available to me as a student and a potential mother, especially living in a rural area with limited access to healthcare. \n\nOverall, I feel like having those conversations is important, but I worry I wouldn\u2019t have the time or support to really dive into those topics with my current provider. It would be great to have someone more approachable who could help me with my specific concerns. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that insight. It sounds like you have a clear idea of what you\u2019d like to discuss if you were to have those prenatal visits. Moving forward, how do you feel about your overall health and your ability to access the resources you need? Are there any specific areas where you feel you need more support?",

I usually try to manage my health with over-the-counter remedies when I can, like pain relievers or throat lozenges when I have issues. \n\nI know that if I were to get pregnant in the future, I would need to be more mindful of any medications I take, and I\u2019d want to make sure that I\u2019m not taking anything that could be harmful. I\u2019ve heard that some vitamins and supplements are important during pregnancy, like folic acid, but I haven\u2019t really looked into what I should take specifically. If I had better access to healthcare, I\u2019d definitely want to have a conversation about that and get some guidance on what would be best for my health and any future pregnancies. \n\nInterviewer: That sounds wise, especially as you think about future health and potential pregnancies.

However, I\u2019ve read a bit about the importance of a balanced diet if someone were to become pregnant. I know that things like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins are essential, along with staying hydrated.\n\nIn my day-to-day life, I try to eat healthily when I can, but being a college student often means I\u2019m juggling classes and work, so I sometimes rely on quick meals or snacks that aren't always the best choices. If I were to get pregnant, I think I would want to focus more on my nutrition and maybe even seek out resources or programs that could help me learn about what to eat for both my health and the baby\u2019s health. I imagine it would be a big adjustment, and having guidance would be really helpful.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard that certain supplements, like prenatal vitamins, are important, especially folic acid, and I\u2019d want to make sure I\u2019m taking those if I were to become pregnant. I think having access to a dietitian or a healthcare provider who could help me with meal planning and nutritional advice would be really beneficial, given my current challenges with accessing healthcare. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s a very insightful perspective, Charlotte. It sounds like you\u2019re aware of the importance of nutrition and how it can impact both your health and a future pregnancy.

I often feel overwhelmed by everything, and I think that if I were to get pregnant, I would need strong emotional support to navigate those feelings. \n\nIf I had access to counseling or support groups for expectant mothers, I think that could really help me process any emotions I might have during a pregnancy. It would be nice to connect with others who are going through similar experiences and be able to share concerns and advice. \n\nOverall, I recognize that emotional well-being is just as important as physical health, and I would want to prioritize that if I were to become pregnant. Having a provider who could help me with both aspects would be really valuable. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s a very thoughtful perspective, Charlotte.

My family has always been there for me, but since we\u2019re not in the best financial situation, I worry about how much they could help. My mom has a lot of life experience, and I think she would provide emotional support, but I also know she might be worried about how I\u2019d manage everything.\n\nMy friends are also a great source of support. They\u2019re going through similar challenges with school, so we often lean on each other for encouragement and advice. If I were to become pregnant, I think it would be really important to have them by my side to share the experience with, as they could relate to the pressures and changes that come with that.\n\nHowever, I sometimes feel like I need more than just emotional support from friends and family. I think having access to a professional support network, like counselors or support groups, would be beneficial. It would be nice to connect with others who are in the same situation or who have gone through pregnancy before. They could provide insights and help me navigate the emotions and challenges I might face.\n\nOverall, I recognize that a strong support network is crucial, and I would want to expand that network to include professionals who could guide me through the journey of pregnancy and motherhood, especially given my unique circumstances.",

I think I would prefer to have a plan that allows for some flexibility, depending on what my situation is at the time. \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that it\u2019s important to have a supportive environment during delivery, whether that means having my family or friends there or having a healthcare provider I trust. It would be nice to feel comfortable and safe during such an important moment. \n\nAdditionally, I know that being prepared with information about what to expect during labor and delivery would ease some of my anxiety.

I also occasionally browse through books and guides at the library, but I haven\u2019t committed to any specific ones yet.\n\nI think having access to more structured information, like workshops or classes focused on pregnancy and childbirth, would be really beneficial. It would be great to have a comprehensive understanding from experts rather than piecing together information from different sources. \n\nOverall, while I\u2019m trying to educate myself, I feel like there\u2019s a lot more I could learn, especially from healthcare professionals who could provide tailored advice and guidance based on my situation.",
