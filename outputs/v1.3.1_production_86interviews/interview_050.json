I believe there would be regular follow-ups to monitor the progress of the pregnancy, check on the baby\u2019s development, and address any questions or concerns that arise. \n\nI imagine that each visit would likely involve measuring weight, checking blood pressure, and possibly some ultrasounds as the pregnancy progresses.
