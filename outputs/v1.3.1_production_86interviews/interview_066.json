I graduated from high school a couple of years ago and currently work as a retail associate. It's not a high-paying job, so money is pretty tight for me. I'm single, and I don't have any kids or plans for pregnancy right now. \n\nAccess to healthcare around here is limited, and I rely on Medicaid for my medical needs. That can be frustrating at times because there are not many providers nearby who accept it, and sometimes I feel like I have to wait a long time for appointments. Plus, with my work schedule, it's hard to find the time to go. I try to stay healthy, but I do have some stress from my financial situation and personal life, and I occasionally use substances to cope. Overall, it's a lot to juggle. \n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to know about my experiences?",

I would also expect to discuss things like nutrition, lifestyle, and any concerns I might have. \n\nI think appointments would probably happen fairly regularly, especially in the first and second trimesters. It seems like they would become more frequent as the pregnancy progresses. I would want to feel like I could ask questions about what to expect and how to take care of myself during that time. \n\nIf I were to get pregnant, I\u2019d be looking for a provider who would take the time to explain everything clearly and who would support me in making the best choices for my health and the health of my baby.

I would also want to be mindful of things like hydration and avoiding certain foods that could be harmful during pregnancy, like raw fish or unpasteurized dairy products.\n\nI\u2019ve read that prenatal vitamins, especially those containing folic acid, are crucial for preventing birth defects and supporting a healthy pregnancy. So, if I were to get pregnant, I\u2019d definitely want to ensure I was taking those regularly.\n\nSince I sometimes struggle with stress and my financial situation makes it hard to eat as healthily as I\u2019d like, I worry about how I could manage my nutrition during pregnancy if I didn\u2019t have access to resources or support.
