I have a high school diploma, and while I enjoy my job, it doesn't pay a lot, so I'm in a lower-middle income bracket. I\u2019m currently single and don\u2019t have any kids, although I did have a miscarriage about a year ago. That was pretty tough for me. \n\nIn terms of my health, I don\u2019t have any chronic conditions, but I do have some occasional issues, like otitis media, which I've dealt with a few times. I\u2019m also underinsured, which makes it hard for me to access healthcare regularly. I try to stay healthy, but I lead a pretty sedentary lifestyle and smoke occasionally, which I know isn\u2019t great. Overall, I do my best to manage, but it can be challenging sometimes. \n\nIs there anything specific you\u2019d like to know about my health or experiences?",

It was really tough for me emotionally, and I didn't have anyone to talk to about it at the time. \n\nAfter the miscarriage, I wasn\u2019t really thinking about getting pregnant again.

It felt really daunting since I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.\n\nWhen I finally went, the experience was a mix of excitement and anxiety. The staff was nice, but I felt a bit out of place, like I didn\u2019t belong there since I was on my own and not sure about the whole process. They did some initial tests and gave me some information, which was helpful, but I didn\u2019t feel like I had a lot of support. \n\nAfter the miscarriage, I didn\u2019t really follow up with any healthcare. I felt lost and confused, and since I wasn\u2019t planning on getting pregnant again, I didn\u2019t see the point. \n\nHave you experienced any barriers to accessing healthcare since then, or do you feel there are specific things that could have made your experience better?",

The clinic I went to had different doctors and nurses, so I didn\u2019t really establish a relationship with anyone in particular. They were all professional and polite, but I didn\u2019t feel a strong connection with anyone. \n\nI think part of that was because I was feeling vulnerable after finding out I was pregnant and then experiencing the miscarriage. I didn\u2019t really feel comfortable opening up or asking questions, partly because I was worried about what they might think of my situation, especially being underinsured and single. \n\nSince then, I haven\u2019t really sought out any healthcare, so I don\u2019t have anyone currently providing care. I guess I\u2019m still trying to process everything, and without a clear plan for another pregnancy, I haven\u2019t felt the need to reach out.\n\nDo you have any other questions about my experiences or thoughts on that situation?",

I guess if I had continued with a pregnancy, a typical visit would have included things like checking my weight, blood pressure, and maybe an ultrasound or some blood tests. But since I ended up having a miscarriage shortly after that first visit, I didn\u2019t experience the routine check-ups that most pregnant women go through.\n\nThat initial visit was a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I remember sitting in the waiting room, feeling a mix of excitement and fear. Once I was called in, the nurse was nice and asked me a lot of questions about my health history. The doctor came in and did some tests, but it all felt so rushed. I had so many questions in my mind, but I didn\u2019t end up asking them because I felt a little intimidated. They gave me some pamphlets and information about what to expect during pregnancy, which was helpful, but I didn\u2019t feel like I had a good grasp on what was happening or what I should do next.\n\nIf I had been able to access regular appointments, I think I would have felt more reassured and supported throughout the pregnancy. But without insurance and being single, it just felt complicated to navigate everything.\n\nIs there anything specific you\u2019d like to know about what I might have experienced in a typical prenatal appointment, or any other aspects related to my care?",

I think I could have benefited from some support or counseling during that time, but, again, accessing that kind of care has been difficult for me. \n\nI guess you could say my biggest health concern has been more about my mental and emotional well-being rather than physical complications during the pregnancy itself. \n\nIs there anything specific you\u2019d like to ask about my experiences with health concerns or how I managed my emotional health after the pregnancy?",

I focused on incorporating more fruits and vegetables, but I still found myself reaching for convenience foods a lot, like quick meals or snacks that weren\u2019t necessarily the best choices.\n\nI remember trying to drink more water and cut back on caffeine since I knew those were important during pregnancy. I didn\u2019t really have a consistent plan, though. I think I could have done better, especially with getting enough nutrients like iron and folic acid. I wasn\u2019t taking any prenatal vitamins at the time, mainly because I wasn\u2019t sure what I should be doing and didn\u2019t have guidance from a healthcare provider.\n\nAfter the miscarriage, I didn\u2019t really change my diet much.

I was overwhelmed by the changes happening in my body and the responsibility that was about to come. \n\nAfter I experienced the miscarriage, though, my emotions took a deeper turn. I felt a profound sense of loss and sadness. It was really tough to process, and I found myself feeling isolated because I didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to about it. I felt like I should have been happier, but the grief just weighed heavily on me. \n\nI also dealt with a lot of guilt and confusion. I kept wondering if I had done something wrong or if there was something I could have done differently. Those thoughts lingered, and I didn't have the support I needed to help work through them. \n\nOverall, my emotional health has been a struggle since the pregnancy and miscarriage.
