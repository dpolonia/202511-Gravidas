I graduated high school, but I haven't pursued any further education yet. My financial situation is a bit tight, so I focus on managing my expenses. \n\nIn terms of my health, I try to maintain a moderately healthy lifestyle; I eat well when I can, and I enjoy being active, but sometimes stress gets in the way. I do have some high-stress levels, mainly due to financial concerns. I occasionally use substances, which I know might not be the healthiest choice, but it\u2019s my way of coping sometimes. Overall, I think my physical health is okay, but there are definitely areas where I could improve. \n\nMentally, I feel a bit overwhelmed at times, especially with everything going on in my life. It's a lot to handle, but I do my best to stay positive and focus on the things I can control. \n\nDoes that help give you a clearer picture?",

I imagine it would be really important to have someone I could trust and feel comfortable with, especially given the challenges I might face with being a first-time parent and navigating the healthcare system. \n\nI\u2019ve heard from friends who have had babies that it can be really overwhelming, and I would want to make sure I could communicate openly with my provider about my concerns and needs. If you have any tips on what to look for in a prenatal care provider, I would love to hear them! \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that.

I imagine they would also cover things like nutrition, exercise, and preparing for childbirth.\n\nIf I were to become pregnant, I think one of the biggest barriers for me would be access to care, especially living in a rural area. There are limited healthcare providers nearby, and transportation can be an issue since I don\u2019t have a reliable vehicle. Additionally, I worry about the costs even with Medicaid. I would want to make sure I\u2019m getting all the necessary tests and screenings, but I know that can add to the stress when it comes to finances.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard from others that sometimes there can be long wait times for appointments. That would be frustrating, especially if I had concerns that needed to be addressed quickly. Overall, I think navigating the whole experience would be challenging, but I would want to make sure I prioritize both my health and the health of my future child. \n\nDoes that answer your question about potential barriers?",

I\u2019ve read that expecting mothers should focus on eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. \n\nCurrently, I try to eat healthy when I can, but my budget can make it difficult to maintain that consistently. Sometimes I rely on cheaper, processed foods because they\u2019re more affordable and accessible, especially in a rural area where fresh produce might not be as easy to find. If I were to become pregnant, I would need to make more conscious choices about what I eat, prioritizing nutrition to support both my health and the health of the baby.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that prenatal vitamins are essential too, especially folic acid, which helps prevent certain birth defects. If I were to get pregnant, I would definitely want to consult with a healthcare provider about the best dietary changes and supplements to consider.\n\nHave you seen any resources or programs that might help people access healthy food options, especially for those who are pregnant?",

I would likely feel happy about the possibility of starting a family, but I would also be worried about the financial implications and whether I would be able to provide a stable environment for my child.

It can be tough sometimes, though, because I worry about how they would react, especially given my current financial situation. I think they would be supportive, but there could also be some pressure or judgment about my ability to handle the responsibilities of parenthood.\n\nIf I ever do get pregnant, I would also want to seek out community resources, like local parenting groups or classes, to connect with other expectant parents.

I\u2019ve heard that having a team of healthcare providers who respect your wishes is crucial, so I would definitely want to choose a provider who aligns with my preferences. \n\nI think I would want to explore pain management options, like epidurals or natural methods, and I would want to communicate my wishes regarding interventions, such as whether I would want to avoid unnecessary medical procedures if possible. \n\nIt\u2019s also important for me to discuss my preferences for who I want to be there during delivery.
