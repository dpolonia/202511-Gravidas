I come from a lower-middle-income family, so I've been managing my finances pretty carefully. I live in an urban area, which has its perks and challenges. \n\nAcademically, I feel a lot of pressure to perform well, which can be really stressful. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but I do occasionally use substances, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Right now, I'm single and not planning on getting pregnant, so I use condoms for contraception. Access to healthcare is a bit limited for me since I rely on Medicaid, which can be a bit of a hassle sometimes. Overall, I'm just trying to balance everything and figure things out as I go. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Hannah. It sounds like you're juggling quite a bit. Could you tell me about your experiences with accessing healthcare services? Have you faced any challenges in that regard?",

It was a bit of a surprise because I wasn't planning on getting pregnant at that time, and it added to my stress. Thankfully, it turned out that I wasn't pregnant, but the whole experience was a bit daunting. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been really focused on being careful and using protection. I think it\u2019s important to be responsible, especially with everything else going on in my life. Do you want me to go into more detail about that experience?",

It was a bit intimidating since I wasn't sure what to expect. The doctor talked to me about the importance of regular check-ups and discussed contraception options. \n\nI remember feeling a mix of relief and anxiety during that appointment. Relief because I found out I wasn\u2019t pregnant, but anxiety because I realized how important it is to stay on top of my health, especially with school and everything else going on. I felt like I could have benefitted from more information about my options. Have you encountered many people who find themselves in similar situations?",

They\u2019re friendly and seem to care, but sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t get enough time to discuss everything I want to. \n\nI often feel rushed during appointments, which can be frustrating. I wish there was more opportunity for me to ask questions, especially about my health and contraception. Since I rely on Medicaid, I know there can be limitations in terms of available providers, which adds another layer of stress.

However, when I do go to the doctor for other health issues, it usually involves a general check-up. A typical visit for me starts with checking my vitals, like blood pressure and temperature. Then, the doctor asks about any symptoms I might be experiencing or concerns I have.\n\nDuring those visits, I often feel like we only touch on the surface of what I want to discuss. For example, I might mention feeling stressed or having questions about my contraception options, but there\u2019s so much going on in my life that I want to explore more deeply. They might give me some advice and then move on to the next patient. I feel like if I had a dedicated provider for prenatal care, things might be different. There could be more focus on my specific needs and concerns. \n\nI guess it\u2019s hard to know exactly what a typical prenatal appointment would be like for someone who is pregnant.

I\u2019ve heard that certain nutrients like folic acid, iron, and calcium are crucial during pregnancy, and I would want to prioritize those in my diet. I think it would be helpful to have access to a nutritionist or resources to help guide me on the best foods to eat for both my health and the baby's health. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to consider how stress can impact eating habits.
