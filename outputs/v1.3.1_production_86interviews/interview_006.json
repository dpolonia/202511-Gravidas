I value a collaborative relationship where I feel heard and respected. Would you like to know more about my experiences with my current healthcare providers?",

I believe there are also screenings and tests that can be done to monitor the health of both the mother and the baby.\n\nIf I were to become pregnant, I would expect to ask questions about lifestyle changes, nutrition, and what to expect during each stage of pregnancy.
