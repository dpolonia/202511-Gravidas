She often checks my vital signs and might run some basic tests if necessary. We also talk about my menstrual cycle and any ovulation tracking I've been doing. \n\nShe takes the time to explain how various lifestyle choices can impact fertility and pregnancy, which I find very helpful.

Some of my favorites include \"What to Expect Before You're Expecting,\" which has been particularly helpful in understanding what I can do to prepare my body for pregnancy. I also look for books that provide insights into different birthing methods and parenting approaches.\n\nIn addition to books, I've been following reputable health websites and blogs that focus on maternal health. These resources often provide articles written by healthcare professionals, which I find reliable and informative. Websites like the American Pregnancy Association and Mayo Clinic have been particularly valuable for understanding pregnancy stages, prenatal care, and tips for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nI\u2019ve also joined an online community of women who are trying to conceive. This platform allows us to share experiences, ask questions, and support each other. It\u2019s been comforting to hear from others who are on a similar journey, and I often find new tips or resources through their recommendations.\n\nLastly, I plan to ask my primary care physician for additional resources or recommendations for classes that might be available in our area once I become pregnant. I believe that attending prenatal classes could provide me with hands-on knowledge and help me connect with other expectant parents.\n\nIf you have suggestions for reputable resources or classes that could further my understanding of pregnancy and childbirth, I would love to hear them!",
