      "text": "Hello, thank you for having me. I appreciate the opportunity to share my experiences. I'm ready when you are. \n\n**Interviewer:** Great, Ava. To start, could you tell me about your experiences with prenatal care during your pregnancies? What was your overall experience like?\n\n**Ava:** Well, I had two pregnancies, both of which were pretty much the same in terms of prenatal care. I went to the clinic for check-ups, but it was mostly just the basics\u2014checking the heartbeat and doing some blood tests. I felt like I didn\u2019t get a lot of information or support beyond that. \n\n**Interviewer:** I see. Can you tell me more about the challenges you faced in accessing prenatal care? \n\n**Ava:** One of the biggest challenges was transportation. We live in a rural area, and getting to the clinic wasn\u2019t always easy. Sometimes my husband had to take time off work to drive me, and if he couldn\u2019t, I just had to miss appointments. It was frustrating because I wanted to make sure everything was okay with my pregnancies.\n\n**Interviewer:** That sounds really tough. Did you have any support systems in place to help you with transportation or any other needs during your pregnancies?\n\n**Ava:** Not really. I had some friends, but they were busy with their own families. I felt pretty isolated at times. I wish I had more support or even someone to talk to about what I was going through.\n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like you went through a lot alone. Did you ever have any difficulties accessing information about your health or prenatal care options?\n\n**Ava:** Yes, definitely. I didn\u2019t always know what questions to ask or what I should be doing. I tried looking things up online, but it was hard to find reliable information. I wish there had been someone to guide me through it all.\n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing that, Ava. It\u2019s important to have access to reliable information. How would you describe your overall health during your pregnancies? Did you experience any pregnancy-related conditions?\n\n**Ava:** I had some common issues, like morning sickness and fatigue. I didn\u2019t really have any serious complications, but I did feel a lot of stress because of everything going on. I think the lack of support and access to care added to that.\n\n**Interviewer:** That sounds very challenging. Did you have any particular experiences or feelings that stand out from your pregnancies in terms of your mental health?\n\n**Ava:** I definitely felt overwhelmed at times. The stress of taking care of two kids already, plus being pregnant, was a lot. I tried to stay positive, but I often felt anxious about how I was going to manage everything. \n\n**Interviewer:** It\u2019s understandable to feel that way. It\u2019s a big transition, especially with limited resources. Looking back, is there anything you wish you could have changed about your prenatal care experience?\n\n**Ava:** I wish I had better access to healthcare and more informative prenatal classes. I think if I had someone to talk to regularly\u2014like a nurse or a counselor\u2014it would have made a big difference. Just having someone listen and guide me through it would have helped a lot.\n\n**Interviewer:** Those are very valid points, Ava. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. As a follow-up, how do you feel about your current access to healthcare now that you've had your children? \n\n**Ava:** It\u2019s still tough. I have Medicaid, but getting to appointments is still a challenge. I don\u2019t go as often as I probably should because I worry about how to get there. It\u2019s frustrating because I want to take care of myself too.\n\n**Interviewer:** I can understand that. Taking care of your health is just as important. Lastly, how do you view the role of your community in supporting maternal health? Do you feel there are resources available for mothers like you?\n\n**Ava:** I don\u2019t see many resources around here. I think if there were more community programs focused on mothers, it could really help. It would be great to have more local support groups or health fairs where we could learn about our health and get connected with services.\n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you so much for sharing your experiences, Ava. Your insights are incredibly valuable, and they highlight some important areas for improvement in maternal health support. Is there anything else you would like to add before we conclude the interview?\n\n**Ava:** No, I think you\u2019ve covered everything. I just hope my experience can help others in similar situations. Thank you for listening. \n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for your openness and for sharing your journey with me today, Ava. Your voice is important, and I appreciate your time.",

It can be quite a handful, especially since they\u2019re both so energetic. I love being home with them, but sometimes I feel like I miss having a job and that sense of independence. We live in a small town in Montana, and while it's beautiful out here, the isolation can be tough. I don't have family nearby, so I mostly rely on my husband for support. He works hard to provide for us, but sometimes it feels like I\u2019m carrying a lot of the family responsibilities on my own. \n\nSince I have a high school diploma, I\u2019ve thought about going back to school or looking for a part-time job, but with the kids being so young and the transportation issues, it just hasn\u2019t been feasible right now. I really want to make sure I\u2019m taking care of myself too, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to find the time or resources to do that. ",

      "text": "**Ava:** I found out I was pregnant with my first child when I was about six weeks along. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. I took a home pregnancy test after I missed my period, and when it came back positive, I was thrilled but also overwhelmed. It was a big change, and I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.\n\nFor my second pregnancy, I found out when my first was just about a year old. I was a little more prepared the second time around, but I still had those same feelings of excitement mixed with anxiety, especially about how I would manage two little ones.\n\nWith both pregnancies, I really hoped to learn as much as I could about what to expect, but like I mentioned before, I didn\u2019t feel like I had enough support or information. It was often just me figuring things out as I went along. \n\n**Interviewer:** That\u2019s understandable, Ava. It sounds like both pregnancies came with their own set of challenges and feelings. How did you feel about the timing of your pregnancies? Did you feel prepared for both of them?\n\n**Ava:** The first pregnancy was a surprise, but I think we were both excited. With the second one, I felt a little more prepared since I had gone through it once before, but I also worried about how I would manage everything with two kids so close in age. Sometimes, I felt like I wasn\u2019t ready, especially since my first was still so young. It was a lot to take in! \n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like there was a lot to balance with both pregnancies. Did you have any specific hopes or plans for how you wanted your pregnancies to go, or for after your babies were born?\n\n**Ava:** I really wanted to have healthy pregnancies and deliveries, and I hoped to bond with my babies after they were born. I also wanted to be able to take care of myself and not lose sight of my own health and well-being. I think I hoped for more resources or support to help me through that, but it didn't quite happen the way I imagined. \n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing that, Ava. It\u2019s really important to have those hopes and plans, and it\u2019s understandable that things don\u2019t always go as envisioned. How did you feel about your postpartum experience after each delivery? \n\n**Ava:** After my first, I was really tired and just trying to adjust to being a new mom. I had some baby blues, I think, but I didn\u2019t really talk to anyone about it. After my second, it was a bit more chaotic, managing a toddler and a newborn. I felt even more overwhelmed and isolated, and I wished I had someone to talk to about what I was feeling. I tried my best to stay positive, but it was hard with so much going on. \n\n**Interviewer:** That sounds really challenging, Ava. It\u2019s so important to have support during that time. Did you feel like you were able to connect with any resources or services for postpartum care?\n\n**Ava:** Not really. I didn\u2019t have much access to postpartum care or support groups in my area. I mostly just relied on my husband and tried to get by. I think some local resources could have made a big difference, but at the time, I just didn\u2019t know where to look or what was available. \n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing your experiences with both your pregnancies and postpartum care. It\u2019s clear that support is crucial during those times. Is there anything else you would like to share about your journey or your thoughts on maternal health?",

      "text": "**Ava:** I first sought prenatal care when I found out I was pregnant with my first child, around six weeks. I went to the local clinic for my first appointment, and I remember being nervous but also excited to see the doctor. They did the usual tests and confirmed the pregnancy, but it felt pretty rushed. I had to fill out a lot of paperwork and then wait for the check-up. The doctor was nice, but I felt like I didn\u2019t get to ask all the questions I had in my head. It was mostly just checking the heartbeat and a few other basics. \n\nFor my second pregnancy, I tried to go in a little earlier, thinking I could get more information or support. But again, it was similar\u2014just the basic check-ups. I wanted to talk more about my concerns and what I could do to stay healthy, but it was hard to get the time and attention I needed. \n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like both experiences were somewhat similar. Did you feel comfortable discussing your needs or concerns with the healthcare providers during those visits?\n\n**Ava:** Not really. I felt a little intimidated and like I didn\u2019t want to take up too much of their time. Plus, sometimes I wasn\u2019t even sure what to ask. I wished I could have had a little more one-on-one time to really dive into my questions, especially since I was feeling so many things\u2014anxiety, excitement, and a bit of fear about being a mom again. \n\n**Interviewer:** That makes sense, Ava. It\u2019s important to feel comfortable and supported during those visits. Were there any particular topics or concerns you wish you had been able to address more thoroughly with your provider?\n\n**Ava:** I really wanted to talk about managing my stress and anxiety, especially with having two kids. I also wished I could have gotten more information on what to expect postpartum because I felt pretty unprepared for that side of things. I think if I had known more about the emotional and physical changes I would go through, it might have helped me feel more at ease. \n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like having more comprehensive discussions about mental health and postpartum care would have been beneficial for you. Were there any specific resources or support services you wished you had access to during your prenatal care visits?\n\n**Ava:** Yes, definitely. I think if there were classes or support groups for new moms, that would have been really helpful. Just having a space to connect with others and share experiences could have made a difference. I also wished there were pamphlets or information sessions about what to expect during and after pregnancy. It would have helped me feel more informed and less alone. \n\n**Interviewer:** Those are great suggestions, Ava. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on what could improve the prenatal care experience. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to mention about your journey or your experiences with healthcare overall? \n\n**Ava:** I just hope that sharing my story can help others who might be feeling the same way. I think it\u2019s really important for mothers, especially in rural areas, to have better access to support and information. It can be so isolating, and every mom deserves to feel heard and cared for. \n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you so much for your openness, Ava. Your experiences and insights are incredibly valuable, and they can contribute to meaningful changes in maternal healthcare. I appreciate your time today.",

      "text": "**Ava:** My prenatal care was provided by a local clinic. The healthcare provider I saw was a general practitioner, not an obstetrician, which I think was part of the issue. I didn\u2019t have a consistent doctor for my pregnancies; it was usually whoever was available when I went in. Sometimes it felt like I was just another patient in line, and I didn\u2019t really build a relationship with any of them. \n\nI appreciated their care, but I often felt rushed during appointments. They were nice, but I didn\u2019t feel like I could really connect or open up about my concerns. I think having a dedicated provider who knows my history and can take the time to listen would have made a big difference in my experience. I really wanted someone who understood me and my situation, especially since I was going through such a big life change. \n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like consistency and connection were lacking in your prenatal care experience. How do you think having a more established relationship with a healthcare provider would have impacted your prenatal care?\n\n**Ava:** I think it would have made me feel more comfortable sharing my worries and asking questions. When you\u2019re pregnant, there\u2019s so much to think about, and having someone who really knows you and your background could help tailor the conversations to what I really needed. I would have felt more supported and less alone in navigating my pregnancies. It\u2019s tough when you feel like you\u2019re just another number in the system. \n\n**Interviewer:** That\u2019s a very valid point, Ava. Building trust and rapport with a healthcare provider can significantly enhance the care experience. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to share about your experience with healthcare providers during your pregnancies? \n\n**Ava:** I just wish there could be more emphasis on building relationships in healthcare, especially for expectant mothers. It\u2019s such a critical time, and having someone who\u2019s genuinely invested in your well-being can make all the difference. I think it would help with mental health too, knowing you have someone in your corner who understands your journey. \n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing that perspective, Ava. It\u2019s so important to foster those relationships in healthcare. Your experiences and thoughts can truly help inform improvements in maternal care.

      "text": "**Ava:** During my pregnancies, I had appointments about once a month in the beginning, and then they increased to every two weeks as I got closer to my due date. A typical visit for me usually started with checking in at the front desk and filling out some paperwork if needed. Then, I\u2019d wait for a little while until a nurse would call me back.\n\nOnce in the exam room, they would take my weight, check my blood pressure, and listen to the baby\u2019s heartbeat, which was always a relief to hear. After that, I\u2019d meet with the doctor or nurse practitioner for a quick chat. They would ask if I had any questions or concerns, but honestly, it felt like the appointments were pretty brief\u2014maybe 10 to 15 minutes at most. \n\nThey\u2019d do some basic tests, like checking my urine, and then I\u2019d be on my way. I often left feeling like I still had more questions than answers. I really wanted to talk about things like my mental health, managing stress, and what to expect after the baby was born, but I just didn\u2019t have the time or space to dive into those topics. \n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like your appointments were quite brief and focused on the basics. Did you feel like you had enough time to address your concerns, or did you feel rushed during those visits?\n\n**Ava:** I definitely felt rushed. I\u2019d often think of questions on the way to the appointment or even while I was waiting, but by the time I got in there, I felt so pressured to just get through the basics that I didn\u2019t want to hold them up. I think if I had a little more time to discuss my concerns, it would have helped me feel more prepared and supported. \n\n**Interviewer:** That\u2019s understandable, Ava. Feeling rushed can really impact your ability to communicate effectively with your provider. Were there any specific questions or topics that you wish you had been able to discuss more in-depth during your appointments?\n\n**Ava:** Yes, I really wanted to talk about what to expect postpartum, especially the emotional side of things. I also had concerns about managing two kids and how to take care of myself in the process. I wished I could have gotten advice on coping strategies or even just reassurance that what I was feeling was normal. \n\n**Interviewer:** Those are important topics that deserve attention during prenatal care.

However, I did experience a lot of stress, especially with managing my home life and the challenges of being a new mom with a toddler while pregnant. \n\nThere were moments when I worried about my mental health, especially after my second child was born. I didn\u2019t necessarily have postpartum depression, but I did feel overwhelmed, anxious, and a bit lost. I think if I had more support or resources to help understand what I was going through, it might have helped me cope better. \n\nI also had some concerns about my weight during my pregnancies. I felt like I was gaining more than I should have, and while my doctors didn\u2019t express any major concerns, I sometimes felt insecure about it. I wish we could have talked more about healthy habits and managing weight from a mental and physical health perspective. \n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like you navigated some significant stressors during your pregnancies, even without major medical complications. Did you find any strategies that helped you manage that stress or your overall well-being during that time?\n\n**Ava:** I tried to focus on taking care of myself when I could, like going for short walks or finding time to relax when the kids were napping. But honestly, it was hard to prioritize myself with everything going on. I didn\u2019t have a lot of time to dedicate to self-care, and sometimes it felt like there was just no break.

At first, I felt a lot of excitement and joy about becoming a mom, but as time went on, I also experienced a lot of anxiety and stress. With my first pregnancy, I was mostly just trying to figure everything out, and I remember feeling overwhelmed by the changes happening in my body and my life.\n\nAfter my second child was born, I felt even more pressure.

I often felt anxious about how I was going to manage everything, and I wished I had someone to talk to who understood what I was going through. \n\nI didn\u2019t really talk about my feelings much, partly because I didn\u2019t want to burden anyone and also because I wasn\u2019t sure if what I was feeling was normal.

However, sometimes he was also busy with work and other responsibilities, so I felt like I was carrying a lot of the emotional load on my own.\n\nI have a few friends, but most of them were also busy with their own families, so it was hard to connect with them about what I was going through. I felt pretty isolated at times, especially in our rural area where there aren\u2019t many local resources or community groups for expecting mothers. I wish I had more access to a support network, like a group for moms where we could share experiences and advice. \n\nOverall, I think the lack of a broader support system made things feel more overwhelming. I really wanted someone to understand what I was going through, and it would have been nice to have a community of other moms to lean on. \n\n**Interviewer:** It's understandable to feel isolated, especially during such a significant life change.

Are there any specific types of support or resources that you wish you had access to during your pregnancies? \n\n**Ava:** Yes, I think having access to a local support group for expecting moms would have been really helpful. Just having a place to share experiences, ask questions, and connect with others in similar situations would have made me feel less alone. Also, resources like parenting classes or workshops on managing stress and mental health during pregnancy would have been beneficial. I think that would\u2019ve helped a lot of moms in our area feel more supported and connected. \n\n**Interviewer:** Those are valuable suggestions, Ava. Creating a strong support network and providing resources for mothers can certainly enhance their experiences. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your support network during your pregnancies. Is there anything else about your support system or maternal health that you\u2019d like to discuss?",

      "text": "**Ava:** I did think about my birth plan, but honestly, it was pretty simple. I wanted to have a vaginal delivery for both of my pregnancies, which I was able to do. My preference was to have as natural a birth as possible, but I also knew that I had to be flexible. \n\nWith my first child, I was nervous and didn\u2019t really know what to expect. I remember wanting to avoid unnecessary interventions, but when it came down to it, I just wanted to make sure my baby was healthy. I think I was so focused on the delivery itself that I didn\u2019t really spend much time thinking about the whole experience or how I would handle pain management.\n\nBy the time I was pregnant with my second, I felt a little more prepared and confident, but the reality was that I still had a lot of anxiety about managing two little ones. I didn\u2019t have a specific birth plan written down or anything like that. I just hoped for a safe delivery and to be able to hold my baby afterward.\n\nI guess I wish I had thought more about my preferences for postpartum care as well, like how I wanted to be supported after the baby was born. It\u2019s just so much to think about, and sometimes it felt overwhelming to plan for everything. \n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like you had a focus on safety and health during your deliveries, which is completely understandable. Did you have any particular concerns or hopes regarding the birth experience itself, like who would be there with you or the environment you would be in?\n\n**Ava:** I definitely wanted my husband there with me; he was my main support. I remember feeling nervous about being in the hospital and not knowing what to expect. I think having familiar faces around would have helped ease my anxiety. I also wished I could have had a more comfortable environment, but since we live in a rural area, I didn\u2019t have many options for birthing centers or anything more home-like. \n\nI think if I had known more about what to expect and had a little more support in terms of my preferences for the environment, it would have made me feel more in control during the process. \n\n**Interviewer:** Those are important considerations, Ava. It\u2019s clear that having support and comfort during delivery can impact the experience significantly. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to share about your thoughts on your birth plan or preferences for delivery?",

I tried to read up on pregnancy and childbirth as much as I could, especially since I didn\u2019t have a lot of access to in-person classes or support groups. I looked for articles and forums online, but sometimes it was overwhelming because there\u2019s so much information out there, and it can be hard to know what\u2019s reliable.\n\nI also watched some videos on YouTube about childbirth and parenting, which were helpful to see what others experienced, but I still felt like I needed more personalized guidance. I wish I could have attended local classes or workshops where I could learn from professionals and ask questions directly.\n\nOverall, I think having more structured resources or community programs to guide me would have made a difference in how prepared I felt for both pregnancy and childbirth. \n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like you utilized a variety of sources, but you still felt there was a gap in personalized support and information. Were there specific topics you were particularly interested in learning more about?\n\n**Ava:** Yes, I really wanted to learn more about managing stress and anxiety during pregnancy, as well as what to expect postpartum. I also wished I had more information about newborn care, especially since I was going to have two young kids close in age. I think having access to local resources or classes that covered those topics would have helped me feel more confident and prepared. \n\n**Interviewer:** Those are very important topics, and it\u2019s great that you were proactive in seeking out information.

      "text": "**Ava:** Managing the financial aspects of pregnancy has been challenging for us. Since we live on a limited income and my husband is the main breadwinner, we have to be very mindful of our expenses. We rely on Medicaid for our healthcare coverage, which helps with prenatal visits and delivery costs, but there are still out-of-pocket expenses that pop up, like co-pays for appointments or medications.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to budget as best as I can, but with the added costs of preparing for a new baby\u2014like diapers, clothes, and other essentials\u2014it can feel overwhelming. We often make do with hand-me-downs or second-hand items to save money. \n\nI also wish I had better access to resources that could help with budgeting or financial planning for families. It feels like there should be more community support for new parents, especially when it comes to managing the costs associated with having a baby. I think if there were workshops or classes focused on financial literacy for expecting parents, it could really help families like mine.\n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like you\u2019re doing your best to navigate the financial side of things, even with the challenges you face. Have you found any specific resources or support that have helped you manage these costs?\n\n**Ava:** Not really. I\u2019ve looked around for local resources, but I haven\u2019t found much. I\u2019ve tried talking to friends and family for advice, but they\u2019re also juggling their own expenses. I think if there were more community programs that focused on helping families prepare financially for a baby, it would make a big difference. Just having that support would help ease some of the stress around finances.\n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing your experiences, Ava.

I had to put any thoughts of returning to work on hold while I was pregnant and after having my children. It\u2019s been a big adjustment, especially since I used to think about going back to school or finding a part-time job to contribute financially.\n\nWith my first pregnancy, I was still figuring out how to manage my time and responsibilities at home. By the time I got pregnant with my second, I realized that juggling two little ones would make it even more challenging to consider employment outside the home. I often feel like I miss having my own income, but I also know that being home with the kids is important for their development.\n\nSometimes I worry about what the future holds in terms of work. I know I need to think about my own career and independence, but right now, it just feels like I have to focus on raising the kids. I wish I had better access to resources or programs that could help me transition back into work when I\u2019m ready. \n\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like you\u2019ve had to make significant adjustments to your plans regarding work and employment. Do you have any specific goals or aspirations regarding your career for the future, once you feel ready to return to work?\n\n**Ava:** Yes, I\u2019ve thought about going back to school to get a degree or certification in something I\u2019m passionate about\u2014maybe in early childhood education or healthcare. I think it would be fulfilling to work in a field where I can help others, especially since I have my own experience as a mom.

I want to make sure I take care of myself this time around. My main plan is to lean on my husband for support as much as possible, as he\u2019s been great about helping out with the kids. \n\nI also want to try to prioritize self-care, even if it\u2019s just taking a few moments for myself when I can. I know how important it is to process my emotions and not just push through everything. I\u2019ve considered reaching out to some local resources for postpartum support, like mothers\u2019 groups or counseling, but I haven\u2019t found anything concrete yet. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a little anxious about how I\u2019ll manage with two kids and a newborn, but I\u2019m hoping to set realistic expectations for myself. I want to be gentle with myself and allow time to adjust to the new routine. I also think I\u2019d like to have conversations with my healthcare provider about what signs to look for regarding postpartum depression or anxiety, so I can be more aware and proactive about my mental health.\n\n**Interviewer:** It\u2019s great to hear that you\u2019re thinking ahead and planning for your postpartum experience. It sounds like you\u2019re aware of the importance of support and self-care during that time. Are there any specific areas where you feel you might need additional support or resources after the baby arrives?\n\n**Ava:** I think having access to information about postpartum health and recovery would be really helpful. I\u2019d like to know more about what to expect physically and emotionally during that time. Also, just having a support network in place would make me feel more secure. If there were local groups for new moms or resources that offered advice on handling the transition, that would be invaluable. I really want to feel connected and not isolated like I did before.\n\n**Interviewer:** Those are very valid points.
