I take the opportunity to ask questions about fertility, nutrition, and any other preparations I can make. My provider is thorough, and they usually take the time to explain things clearly, which I appreciate.\n\nIf I do become pregnant, I understand that prenatal visits will likely become more frequent, and I look forward to experiencing that process.
