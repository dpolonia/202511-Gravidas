It\u2019s a fun job, but it can be pretty demanding, especially during busy hours. I have a high school diploma, but I haven't pursued further education yet. Financially, things are a bit tough since I'm in a lower-middle-income bracket, and I feel like I'm just getting by most of the time. \n\nI\u2019m single and don\u2019t have any kids, though I have thought about it occasionally. I don\u2019t have great health insurance, which makes it hard for me to access healthcare when I need it. I don\u2019t exercise much, which I know isn\u2019t great, and I smoke occasionally. Overall, I try to manage my health as best as I can, but I do have a few medical conditions like atopic dermatitis and I\u2019ve had acute bronchitis recently. That's kind of where I\u2019m at right now. \n\nHow about you? What kind of information are you looking for in this interview?",

I\u2019ve heard that there are various ways to give birth, like at a hospital or even at home, and each has its pros and cons.\n\nI think I would prefer to be in a hospital setting just because it feels safer to me, especially knowing that there could be complications during delivery. I would want to have a healthcare team that I trust and who can guide me through the process.

Hearing personal stories can be really helpful because it makes things feel more relatable and less intimidating. Occasionally, I look at books or pamphlets if I come across them, but I haven\u2019t invested in any specific pregnancy books yet.\n\nI think if I were to get pregnant, I would want to seek out more structured information, maybe even attend some classes or workshops to learn about prenatal care and childbirth.
