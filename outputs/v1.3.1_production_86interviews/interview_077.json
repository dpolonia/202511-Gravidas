I come from a lower-middle-income family, so finances are often tight, which adds a lot of stress to my life. I'm single and focusing on my studies, but I do occasionally find time to hang out with friends. I try to maintain a moderately healthy lifestyle, but sometimes I struggle with stress and the pressures of school and finances. I don\u2019t have easy access to healthcare, just Medicaid, which can be limiting. Overall, I'm navigating my way through this phase of life as best as I can.",

They also mentioned discussions about nutrition and what to expect during pregnancy. It sounds like those visits can be really important for both the mother and the baby, but I've also heard that sometimes it can feel rushed or overwhelming, especially if there are long wait times. \n\nIf I were to become pregnant, I think I would want to feel more connected to my healthcare provider during those visits, to have someone who would take the time to answer my questions and address any concerns.
