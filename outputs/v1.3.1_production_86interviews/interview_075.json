I'm also a mother of three, and I had all my children through cesarean deliveries. I manage my type 2 diabetes fairly well, and I try to stay active, although I don't exercise as much as I should.

All three of my pregnancies were pretty straightforward, but I ended up having to have cesarean sections for each delivery.

She was thorough and always took the time to answer my questions, which I appreciated. The prenatal care visits became a routine for me, and even though I was nervous about the cesarean sections, I felt reassured by the support from my doctor and the healthcare team.\n\nHow about you?

Toward the end, especially after I was around 36 weeks, I started seeing my OB-GYN weekly.\n\nA typical visit usually started with checking my weight and blood pressure. Since I have type 2 diabetes, they would also monitor my blood sugar levels closely. After that, I would have a discussion with my doctor about how I was feeling and any concerns I had. She would always ask about my diet and exercise, which I found really helpful, especially in managing my diabetes.\n\nThen came the fun part\u2014usually, we would do an ultrasound to check on the baby's development. I loved seeing those first images! After the ultrasound, we would talk about the results, and she would explain everything in detail. If there were any tests to be done, like blood work or screenings, she would go over those with me as well.\n\nThe visits would often end with her asking if I had any questions or concerns, which I appreciated.

She recommended safe remedies and treatments that wouldn\u2019t affect the babies. \n\nThe biggest concern was always around the cesarean deliveries, but my doctor assured me that they were necessary for my safety and the babies' well-being.

I knew that maintaining stable blood sugar levels was crucial for both my health and the health of my babies. I focused on eating a balanced diet that included plenty of whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables. \n\nI tried to limit my intake of sugary foods and refined carbohydrates, which was a bit of a challenge at times, especially with cravings. I also made it a point to monitor my carbohydrate intake to keep my blood sugar stable. My OB-GYN worked with me to develop a meal plan that suited my needs, and I would often consult with a dietitian as well, which was very beneficial.\n\nI made sure to eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day to help manage my blood sugar levels. Snacks like nuts, yogurt, or cheese sticks became staples for me, as they provided sustained energy without causing spikes in my blood sugar.\n\nAdditionally, I found it helpful to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water.

There were moments when I worried about my blood sugar levels and how they might affect the pregnancies. Hormonal changes also contributed to mood swings, which could be challenging at times. I remember feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the changes happening in my body and life.\n\nHaving supportive family and friends made a big difference. They were always there to listen and encourage me. My husband was particularly understanding, and that helped me navigate the emotional ups and downs. I also found it beneficial to talk openly with my OB-GYN about my feelings; she reassured me and helped me find strategies to cope with the stress.\n\nOverall, while there were challenging moments, I tried to focus on the positives and the joy of becoming a mother.

My friends were supportive as well; some of them had been through pregnancies themselves, so they understood what I was experiencing emotionally and physically.

I wanted to ensure that I had a supportive environment in the operating room, and I requested that my husband be there with me during the delivery. It was important for me to have that familiar face to help ease my nerves.\n\nI also expressed my desire for skin-to-skin contact with the baby as soon as possible after delivery, as I had read about the benefits of bonding and breastfeeding right after birth. I wanted to be actively involved in the initial moments with my newborn, even though the delivery method was different from a vaginal birth.\n\nAdditionally, I communicated with my healthcare team about my concerns regarding pain management and recovery, given my history of cesarean sections. I wanted to ensure that I would have adequate support and resources available to help with my recovery so that I could focus on my new baby and my other children.\n\nOverall, while my birth plan was more about preferences and ensuring a supportive atmosphere rather than a standard approach, I felt good knowing I had open communication with my healthcare provider.

One book that I found particularly helpful was about managing diabetes during pregnancy, which gave me insights into how to best take care of myself and my babies.\n\nIn addition to books, I used reputable websites and online forums to gather information. I found websites from organizations like the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to be very informative. They had sections dedicated to pregnant women with diabetes, which addressed my specific concerns.\n\nI also participated in a few local parenting classes that covered childbirth and breastfeeding. These classes were great for connecting with other expectant mothers and sharing experiences. They also provided practical tips that I found useful. \n\nLastly, talking to friends and family who had gone through pregnancies was another way I gathered information.

Since I have private health insurance, I was fortunate that many of my prenatal care visits, ultrasounds, and necessary tests were covered. However, I still had to consider out-of-pocket expenses, especially since I had three pregnancies close together.\n\nTo prepare for the financial side of things, I created a budget that included all the expected costs associated with having a baby. This included not just medical expenses but also baby supplies like diapers, clothing, and nursery items. I made a list of essential items and prioritized them, focusing on what we truly needed versus what might be considered luxuries.\n\nI also looked for ways to save money. For example, I took advantage of baby showers, where friends and family generously gifted us with essentials. I also didn\u2019t hesitate to accept hand-me-downs from friends who had children, which helped reduce costs significantly. \n\nSince my husband and I both work, we discussed our financial situation and made a plan to set aside some savings specifically for baby-related expenses. We also ensured that we had a financial cushion in case of unexpected expenses, like medical emergencies or additional healthcare needs.\n\nI found it helpful to keep an open line of communication with my healthcare provider regarding costs as well. They were able to provide estimates for various services, which helped me plan better.\n\nOverall, while it required some effort and organization, having a clear plan and support from my husband and family made it more manageable.
