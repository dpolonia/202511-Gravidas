I graduated high school and have been working in this role for a few years now. My income is on the lower side, so I rely on Medicaid for my healthcare needs. I\u2019m single and focusing on my career and personal development at the moment. I try to maintain a moderately healthy lifestyle, although I do smoke occasionally and experience some stress related to my finances. I\u2019m not currently planning on getting pregnant, and I use condoms for contraception. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Evelyn. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate.

My relationship with them is pretty straightforward; I go in for check-ups or if I have something specific I need to address, like my ear infections or sinus issues. They are generally helpful, but I often feel rushed during appointments since they have many patients to see. I would imagine that if I were to get pregnant, I would want someone who could give me more personalized attention and guidance throughout the process. It can be tough sometimes to connect with healthcare providers, especially when there are so many patients they need to attend to. \n\nInterviewer: I understand that navigating the healthcare system can sometimes feel overwhelming.

I\u2019ve heard from friends that typical visits usually involve checking the baby's heartbeat, discussing any concerns, and getting tests done to monitor health. \n\nI think having a supportive healthcare provider who takes the time to explain things clearly would be really important for me. It would also be helpful to have access to educational resources about what to expect during pregnancy and how to maintain my health. I\u2019d want to feel like I could ask questions without feeling rushed. Emotional support would also be crucial, especially given my financial worries and the stress that can come with pregnancy. \n\nIf I had access to community programs or support groups, that could really help me feel more confident and less isolated during that time.

It would be essential for me to focus on getting those nutrients, especially if I were to become pregnant.\n\nCurrently, I try to eat a moderately healthy diet, but sometimes my budget limits my options.
