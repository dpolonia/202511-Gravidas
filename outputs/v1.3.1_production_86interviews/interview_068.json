However, I\u2019ve learned from my colleagues and through my research that typical prenatal visits usually occur every four weeks during the first trimester, then every two weeks during the second trimester, and weekly in the third trimester. \n\nI imagine that during these visits, healthcare providers monitor the baby's growth and development, check for any potential complications, and address any concerns the mother might have. I think there would also be discussions around nutrition, exercise, and mental health, which are all crucial during pregnancy. \n\nI\u2019m particularly interested in how they manage any existing health issues, like my recent experience with acute bronchitis or gingivitis, during pregnancy.
