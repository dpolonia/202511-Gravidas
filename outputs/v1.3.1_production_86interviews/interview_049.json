I've been working on my studies, but sometimes I feel a lot of pressure with school and social stuff. I do my best to stay active and eat healthy, but I think my stress levels are pretty high right now. \n\nIn terms of health, I\u2019ve had a few issues recently, like a sore throat that turned out to be strep, and I\u2019m dealing with some dental problems like gingivitis and cavities. I have Medicaid for some health access, but I still feel limited in what I can get.

My experiences with healthcare providers have been mixed. \n\nI\u2019ve had some good interactions where I felt listened to and understood, but there have also been times where I felt rushed or like my concerns weren\u2019t fully addressed. I think it\u2019s really important to have a provider that you trust, especially when it comes to something as significant as pregnancy. \n\nIf I were to get pregnant, I would want someone who could provide me with clear information and support throughout the process.

I\u2019ve heard that in the beginning, appointments might be spaced out a bit more, but they can get closer together as you get closer to your due date. \n\nI think it would be helpful to have a checklist or some kind of guide to know what to expect during those visits.
