I want to ensure that we have a supportive team around us, including nurses and the healthcare provider, who respect our choices and communicate openly.\n\nI understand that flexibility is key during labor and delivery, as things can change quickly, but having a foundation for my preferences can help guide the experience.

They cover topics ranging from fertility and nutrition to prenatal care and labor options. I find that these sites are very helpful because they are research-backed and provide the latest recommendations.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve been watching videos and listening to podcasts that feature discussions with healthcare professionals, as well as personal stories from other women who have gone through pregnancy. Hearing firsthand experiences has been invaluable and gives me different perspectives on what to expect.\n\nSocial media has also been a source of information for me. I follow accounts that focus on maternal health and wellness, and I find that community discussions can be insightful. However, I\u2019m careful to cross-reference the information I find online with trusted sources to ensure accuracy.\n\nLastly, I'm planning to attend prenatal classes when I become pregnant, as I believe that hands-on learning and connecting with others will be beneficial. \n\nWhat other sources of information do you think are valuable for someone preparing for pregnancy and childbirth?
