I graduated from high school last year, and I'm hoping to work my way through college. Money is tight since I'm on a low income, and I rely on Medicaid for health insurance. \n\nI don't have any chronic health conditions, but I do have a few dental issues, like a leaking filling and gingivitis, which I've been meaning to get checked out. I also had viral sinusitis recently, which wasn't fun at all. I'm mostly sedentary, and I smoke occasionally, though I know I should probably quit. Overall, I'm just trying to balance school and everything else while taking care of my health. \n\nI am sexually active but not planning on getting pregnant. I try to use condoms, but I admit I don't always use them consistently, which makes me a bit anxious sometimes. That's pretty much my current situation!",

I imagine it can be overwhelming, especially for someone my age. I think I would want to find a healthcare provider I felt comfortable with, but given my limited access to healthcare, I\u2019m not sure how easy that would be. \n\nDo you have any suggestions on how I could prepare myself or what I should know, even if I\u2019m not currently pregnant?",

Transportation is a challenge for me, and I often worry about how I would get to appointments if I needed regular check-ups for prenatal care. \n\nWhen I do go in for other health issues, I appreciate that they listen to me, but I sometimes feel rushed during the appointments. It would be nice to have more time to ask questions and discuss my concerns, especially around topics related to sexual health and family planning. \n\nIf I were to become pregnant, I think I would want to find a provider who specializes in prenatal care and who I could trust to guide me through the process.

I\u2019ve heard that during these visits, they might do ultrasounds, monitor weight gain, and provide guidance on how to stay healthy during pregnancy. \n\nBut honestly, the thought of it makes me a bit anxious. I worry about whether I would be able to afford the visits or how I would get to them, especially since transportation is a concern for me.
