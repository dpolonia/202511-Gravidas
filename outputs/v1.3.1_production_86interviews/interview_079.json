I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom, which keeps me pretty busy with the kids. We have a middle-income household, and I rely on Medicaid for our healthcare coverage. Life can get hectic, but I try to manage everything as best as I can. My health hasn\u2019t been the best lately, especially with chronic neck pain that I\u2019ve been dealing with for a while.

I remember taking a home pregnancy test and then calling my husband right away to share the news. I had three pregnancies in total, all of which were vaginal deliveries. The last one was about five years ago, and since then, I\u2019ve decided not to have any more children. I\u2019m currently using barrier contraception to make sure of that. Each pregnancy had its own challenges, but I think I managed pretty well overall. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s great to hear that you managed well.

I remember feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness when I went to my first appointment. The clinic was a bit busy, and I had to wait longer than I expected, which made me anxious. \n\nOnce I finally saw the doctor, they were really nice and answered all my questions, which helped ease my worries. They did all the usual checks\u2014weight, blood pressure, and ultrasound\u2014to make sure everything was progressing normally. However, I did feel like I could have used more time to discuss my concerns, especially since it was my first pregnancy. \n\nFor my subsequent pregnancies, I went to the same clinic, but I noticed that the care felt a bit rushed. I think it was just the way the appointments were scheduled. With three kids, I definitely had my hands full, and sometimes it felt hard to get the attention I needed. I often left feeling like I had more questions than answers. \n\nWould you like to know how the experience varied between each pregnancy?",

I mostly saw a particular doctor who seemed to be there for most of my appointments. I appreciated that he was friendly and knowledgeable, but I sometimes felt like there were so many patients that he couldn\u2019t spend as much time with me as I would have liked. \n\nI think I built a decent rapport with him, but I always wished I could have had a bit more one-on-one time to discuss my specific concerns, especially since I was a first-time mom at the time. With each pregnancy, I felt like I had to adjust to different doctors or practitioners at the clinic because of the busy schedule, which made it hard to feel completely comfortable. \n\nIf I had a specific concern, like my chronic neck pain or any other issue, it sometimes felt like I had to bring it up myself, rather than it being addressed in my appointments. Overall, the relationship was okay, but I think more continuity and personalization in care would have made a big difference for me.\n\nDo you want me to go into more detail about how my health issues were handled during those appointments?",

A typical visit usually started with me checking in at the front desk and waiting in the waiting room, which was often busy. I would usually wait for about 30 minutes or more before being called back.\n\nOnce in the exam room, a nurse would take my weight and blood pressure and ask a few general questions about how I was feeling. After that, I'd wait for the doctor to come in. When the doctor arrived, they would go over my health history, do a quick physical exam, and often perform an ultrasound to check on the baby. They would listen to the heartbeat and measure my belly to see how the baby was growing.\n\nWhile I appreciated these checks, I often felt like the conversation was a bit rushed. I\u2019d have a few questions prepared, but sometimes it felt like I didn\u2019t have enough time to ask everything I wanted. I remember feeling anxious about my chronic neck pain, especially since it was something I had been dealing with for a while. I would bring it up, but it often felt secondary to the pregnancy-related questions.\n\nAfter the check-up, they would schedule the next appointment and remind me about what to expect in the coming weeks. I appreciated that they always provided some educational materials about pregnancy and what to expect, but I often wished for more time to discuss my personal situation.\n\nWould you like to hear more about any specific aspects of these appointments or how I felt about them?",

I experienced some complications related to my chronic neck pain, which was challenging to manage while pregnant. Sometimes the pain would flare up, and I found it difficult to find comfortable positions, especially as my body changed. I brought this up during my appointments, but it often felt like it wasn't prioritized since they were focused on the pregnancy itself. \n\nThere were also moments of anxiety about my overall health and how it could affect my pregnancy. I remember worrying about how my lifestyle, like my occasional smoking and limited physical activity, might impact my babies. I tried to cut back on smoking during my pregnancies, but it was tough, especially with the stress of being a mom to three kids. \n\nIn terms of pregnancy-related complications, I did have some mild gestational hypertension during my second pregnancy, which required extra monitoring. It was a bit scary because I had to visit the clinic more frequently, and I felt the pressure to manage my stress and health better. The staff was supportive, but I still felt overwhelmed at times.\n\nOverall, while I had some concerns, I was fortunate that my pregnancies progressed without major complications.

I aimed for a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins, but it wasn't always easy to stick to that, especially with three kids to care for. I often found myself grabbing whatever was quick and easy, which sometimes meant less nutritious meals.\n\nIn the beginning, I was really motivated to eat well, and I would plan meals ahead of time. I tried to incorporate more fruits and vegetables, and I made sure to drink plenty of water. However, as the pregnancies progressed and life got busier, I found it challenging to maintain that balance. There were days when I relied on convenience foods and snacks that weren't the healthiest options, especially when the kids were demanding my attention.\n\nI also experienced some cravings during my pregnancies, which sometimes led me to indulge in things like ice cream or salty snacks. I tried not to feel too guilty about it since I thought it was normal, but I did worry about how it might affect my health and the baby's development. \n\nI remember one of my doctors suggesting I keep a food diary to help me stay on track, which I found helpful in the beginning, but I didn't keep up with it for long. I think having more support or guidance about nutrition would have made a difference, especially with my busy lifestyle.\n\nWould you like to hear more about how I managed my diet while juggling everything, or is there another area you want to explore?",

Being a mom to three kids already meant I had a lot on my plate, and I often worried about how I would manage everything once the new baby arrived.\n\nThere were days when I felt overwhelmed, especially when dealing with my chronic neck pain.

I also had moments of self-doubt, questioning whether I was doing everything right for my growing family.\n\nI tried to lean on my husband for support, and he was great at helping me when I needed it. Still, I think I would have benefited from more emotional support from healthcare providers during my appointments. Sometimes, it felt like the focus was entirely on the physical aspects of the pregnancy, and I wished there was more room for discussing my emotional well-being.\n\nPostpartum, I did experience some feelings of sadness and maybe what you would call the \u201cbaby blues.\u201d It was a lot to juggle, and while I was grateful for my children, I found it challenging to adjust to the changes in my life and body. I think having more resources or support systems in place would have made a significant difference in how I felt emotionally during and after my pregnancies.\n\nWould you like to know more about specific coping strategies I used or how I managed my emotional health during that time?",

She would come over to help with the kids, especially during the later stages of my pregnancies when I was feeling more uncomfortable.\n\nMy friends were supportive too, but I didn\u2019t lean on them as much as I probably should have. Most of them were busy with their own lives and families, so while we would chat and share experiences, I didn't want to burden them with my struggles. I think I sometimes felt isolated, especially when I was dealing with my chronic pain or emotional challenges.\n\nI also tried to connect with other moms in the area, which was nice. We would share tips and support each other, but I didn\u2019t always have the time to attend group meet-ups or activities. I often wished I had more access to community resources or support groups, especially for moms dealing with similar challenges.\n\nOverall, my husband and family were my main pillars of support, but I think having more structured support, like from healthcare providers or community programs, would have made a difference in how I navigated my pregnancies.

I preferred to go into labor naturally, and I hoped for a calm environment during delivery, with my husband by my side for support.\n\nFor my last pregnancy, I remember discussing my preferences with my doctor during my appointments. I wanted to avoid unnecessary interventions unless absolutely necessary, and I was open to using pain management options if needed, depending on how things went. I wanted to try to have a relatively straightforward delivery, but I also understood that things could change quickly, especially since I was dealing with chronic neck pain. \n\nI think having a more concrete birth plan would have helped me feel more prepared and empowered, but with everything going on, it sometimes felt overwhelming to think about all the details.

However, sometimes I felt like I needed more detailed information than what was covered during those visits.\n\nI also turned to books and online resources. I read a couple of popular pregnancy books that my friends recommended, which helped me understand what to expect week by week. Websites like the Mayo Clinic and What to Expect were also valuable for finding information about pregnancy symptoms, nutrition, and labor. I appreciated the forums where other moms shared their experiences, although I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the amount of information available online.\n\nAdditionally, I would occasionally watch videos about childbirth, which I found helpful in visualizing the process. However, with everything going on in my life, I often struggled to find the time to dedicate to learning as much as I wanted to.\n\nI think having a more structured approach to education, like attending prenatal classes or workshops, would have been beneficial.

Since I rely on Medicaid for healthcare coverage, many of my prenatal visits and necessary tests were covered, which was a relief. However, there were still other costs associated with preparing for a baby, like buying baby supplies, clothes, and other essentials. \n\nI tried to budget as best as I could, but with three kids already, expenses were always tight. I often looked for sales and used coupons whenever I could to save money on baby items. I also found myself reaching out to family and friends for hand-me-downs, which helped a lot. It was nice to receive things from those who had recently had babies, and it took some pressure off our budget.\n\nWhen it came to planning for medical expenses, I made sure to keep track of co-pays and any out-of-pocket costs for things like ultrasounds or additional tests. I sometimes worried about how our finances would stretch once the new baby arrived, especially with the added costs of childcare and other necessities.\n\nI think it would have been helpful to have more resources or guidance on financial planning for pregnancy and childcare. I didn't really know where to turn for advice, and sometimes I felt lost in figuring out how to manage everything.

However, I think about how my situation might have been different if I had been working outside the home. \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant for the first time, I was actually working part-time. But as my pregnancy progressed and I had to manage the physical demands of carrying a child along with my job, it became clear that it would be challenging to balance both. I ultimately decided to leave my job to focus on my health and the pregnancy, which was a tough decision since I enjoyed my work and the extra income was helpful.\n\nWith each subsequent pregnancy, I continued to stay home full-time. It was important for me to be present for my kids, especially as they were growing up. I worried about how I would manage everything once the new baby arrived, and I felt that being at home would allow me to focus on their needs and my health.\n\nFinancially, being a stay-at-home mom had its challenges. While I appreciated the time with the kids, it also meant we had to stick to a stricter budget. I often thought about how I might eventually want to return to work, but I wanted to wait until my kids were a bit older and more independent.\n\nI believe having more support or resources for moms who are navigating work and pregnancy could be beneficial.
