I graduated high school, but I haven't pursued any further education. My job doesn't pay a lot, so my income is pretty low, and unfortunately, I don\u2019t have health insurance. \n\nIn my personal life, I'm single, and I don't have any kids. My health has been a bit of a challenge for me; I deal with atopic dermatitis and seasonal allergies that can get pretty bad. I had asthma as a child, and I still struggle with it sometimes, especially during allergy season. I also have some issues with my teeth, which has been tough. I try to stay active when I can, but I\u2019m mostly sedentary due to my job and my living situation. \n\nI do smoke occasionally, which I know isn\u2019t great for my health, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been trying to cut back on. Overall, I do my best to manage my health with what I have, but access to healthcare is really limited where I live. \n\nDoes that give you a good picture of where I'm at?",

I use condoms for contraception, but to be honest, I don't always remember to use them consistently. \n\nIt hasn't really been a focus for me since I'm still figuring things out with my job and my health.

I think there would also be discussions about nutrition and lifestyle, which I know are really important during pregnancy.\n\nBut honestly, since I don't have experience with this, I\u2019m a bit unsure about what exactly to expect.

I know I should be focusing on things like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein, but sometimes I rely on processed foods because they\u2019re cheaper and easier to prepare. \n\nIf I were pregnant, I think I would want to learn more about what specific foods I should be eating to support both my health and the baby's development.
