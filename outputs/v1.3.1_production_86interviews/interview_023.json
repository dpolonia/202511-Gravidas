I have a high school diploma, and I'm working towards my degree, but my income is pretty low right now since I\u2019m only taking classes and not working full-time. I live alone, and I'm single. I have Medicaid for insurance, which helps a bit, but I still find it hard to access healthcare services.

I know I should probably schedule an appointment to discuss my gum issues and overall health, but it can be tough to find the time and resources. When I did see my doctor in the past, I felt okay about the relationship. They seemed caring and willing to listen, but I often felt rushed during appointments, which made it hard to ask all my questions.
