Currently, I'm single and living in a middle-income household. I have access to good healthcare through my employer, which I appreciate. \n\nI'm moderately health-conscious and try to exercise occasionally, although I could be better about it. I make sure to keep up with basic preventive care, and thankfully, I don't have any chronic conditions. \n\nRight now, I'm actively planning for pregnancy, which has been an exciting journey for me. I've been taking prenatal vitamins for the last three months, and I feel supported by my friends and family during this time. Overall, I'm in a good place, but I do experience some stress from work and other responsibilities. \n\nDoes that cover what you were looking for?",
