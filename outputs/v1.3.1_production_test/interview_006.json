I come from a low-income household, which makes things a bit tough for me financially. I rely on the local free clinic for my healthcare because I don\u2019t have insurance. Right now, I\u2019m dealing with a lot, especially because I recently found out I'm pregnant, and that\u2019s been really overwhelming for me. I don\u2019t have much support from my family, and I\u2019m not sure what to do about the pregnancy. I also have some health issues, like gingivitis and not feeling well lately.

Since I\u2019m in college and don\u2019t have a stable job or income, it\u2019s been really stressful trying to figure out how I can handle this situation. Have you had any prenatal care yet?",

I went to the local free clinic because that\u2019s where I usually go for my health needs. The staff there were really kind, but I felt kind of out of place. Since I don\u2019t have insurance, I was worried about how much everything would cost. They did some basic checks, like confirming the pregnancy and checking my overall health. It felt a bit rushed, though. I could tell they were busy, and I didn\u2019t get to ask all the questions I had. They told me to come back for follow-ups, but I\u2019m nervous about keeping up with that since my situation is so unstable right now. How do you feel about the care you're receiving?

When I go in, I check in at the front desk, and then I wait for my name to be called. Once I\u2019m in the exam room, the nurse usually takes my vitals and asks me a few questions about how I\u2019ve been feeling. Then the nurse practitioner comes in, and we go over any symptoms I might have or any concerns. They do some basic checks, like measuring my belly and listening for the baby\u2019s heartbeat, which is always a relief to hear. Most of the time, the appointments last around 15-20 minutes, and then I\u2019m out the door. I sometimes wish I had more time to ask questions or discuss my worries, especially since I\u2019m feeling so uncertain about everything.

I also get these sore throats sometimes, which I think might be from that acute viral pharyngitis I\u2019ve been dealing with. It makes me nervous because I don\u2019t want to risk anything for the baby. I know I need to make some changes to my lifestyle, like eating better and cutting back on smoking and drinking, but it\u2019s hard to stay motivated and figure out what\u2019s best when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed.

I know I should be focusing on fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins, but it\u2019s hard when I\u2019m busy with school and don\u2019t have a lot of money.
