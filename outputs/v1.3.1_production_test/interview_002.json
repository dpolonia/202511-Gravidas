We've been married for several years now, and we've been trying to start a family for the past two years. It\u2019s been a bit of a journey for us, especially since we\u2019ve had to explore fertility treatments like IUI. Thankfully, we have good health insurance through my husband's job, which has made it easier to access the care we need. I\u2019m generally health-conscious and try to lead an active lifestyle, but the whole process of trying to conceive has been challenging. I appreciate our social support network; it really helps to talk to friends and family about what we\u2019re going through.\n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Fatima.

Since then, we've been working with a fertility specialist and have undergone IUI treatments. I still hold onto hope, but it has definitely been an emotional rollercoaster. \n\nInterviewer: I'm really sorry to hear about your miscarriage, Fatima.

I first sought prenatal care about six months after we started trying to conceive, especially after the loss. I wanted to make sure that I was as healthy as possible and that we were doing everything we could to increase our chances of getting pregnant again. \n\nThe experience was a mix of hope and anxiety for me. On one hand, I felt reassured knowing that I had a medical team supporting us. My doctor was very understanding and took the time to answer all my questions, which I really appreciated. On the other hand, it was hard to go through the appointments, knowing what I had experienced before. I often felt a sense of trepidation whenever I stepped into the clinic, wondering if we would get good news or face another disappointment.\n\nInterviewer: It sounds like that was a significant and emotional step for you.

They take the time to explain everything, which helps ease some of my anxiety. \n\nI feel comfortable bringing up my concerns, whether they\u2019re about the fertility treatments or my emotional well-being. They\u2019ve been supportive and have provided resources to help me cope with the emotional aspects of this process, which I think is crucial. \n\nMy primary care physician is also supportive, but our visits tend to focus more on my overall health rather than the fertility treatments.

After the medical checks, we have discussions about our options, whether it\u2019s continuing with IUI or considering other treatments. \n\nI often have a list of questions and concerns, especially relating to my emotional health and how the treatments might affect my body.
