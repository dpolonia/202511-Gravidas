I also work part-time, but my job is pretty flexible, so I can manage my school schedule. I live in a rural area in Maine, which can feel a bit isolating sometimes. My family comes from a low-income background, and I\u2019m on Medicaid for health insurance. Honestly, I don\u2019t really think about my health that much, and I don\u2019t see a doctor regularly.

      "text": "Persona: Well, since I haven't been pregnant, I haven't actually sought out any prenatal care. I know that it's important for those who are pregnant, but for me, I just haven\u2019t had that experience. Sometimes I think about how I might feel if I were to get pregnant, and I imagine I would want to make sure I had good care, but right now, it\u2019s not something I have to deal with. \n\nInterviewer: That makes sense. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re thinking about these things. If you were to find out you were pregnant, do you feel like you would know where to go for care or support? \n\nPersona: I guess I would try to find a local clinic or maybe ask friends who have been pregnant or had kids. But honestly, I\u2019m not sure how easy it would be to get that kind of care around here. The healthcare resources feel limited, especially living in a rural area. I would be a bit worried about finding the right information and support. \n\nInterviewer: I understand that can be a concern. Have you ever had any discussions with healthcare providers about family planning or contraception? \n\nPersona: Not really. I\u2019ve had a couple of check-ups when I was younger, but I don\u2019t think I ever really talked about family planning. It\u2019s just not something that comes up often for me. I mostly just use condoms, and that\u2019s been my way of handling things. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that. Sometimes discussions about family planning can be challenging, especially if there\u2019s limited access to healthcare. Do you feel comfortable talking to someone, like a healthcare provider, about your health and any concerns you might have?\n\nPersona: I mean, I\u2019d probably be a bit nervous talking to someone about my health. I don\u2019t see doctors often, and I\u2019m not really sure how to start those kinds of conversations. I feel like I wouldn\u2019t even know what questions to ask. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s completely understandable; many people feel that way. If you did have questions or concerns, what would you want to know about your health or family planning?\n\nPersona: I think I would want to know more about what my options are if I ever did get pregnant. Like, what kind of care I would need and how to take care of myself and the baby. I\u2019d also want to know about any risks or things I should be aware of, especially since I don\u2019t see a doctor often. \n\nInterviewer: Those are very important questions. It\u2019s good to be informed about your options and health. Have you had any experiences with healthcare that have shaped how you view seeking care or using services in general?\n\nPersona: I guess my experiences have been pretty limited. I\u2019ve gone to the clinic a few times when I was younger, but I haven\u2019t had any major health issues or anything that required me to go more often. Sometimes I feel like it\u2019s hard to make time for it with school and work. Plus, living in a rural area makes it feel like a hassle to get to a doctor. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s a valid concern, balancing school, work, and healthcare access can be really challenging. Are there any barriers you feel prevent you from seeking healthcare more regularly?\n\nPersona: Yeah, definitely. Time is a big one, and then there\u2019s the travel distance. I also worry about costs, even with Medicaid; sometimes I hear stories about people having trouble with getting care or the costs of certain services. It makes me hesitant to even look into it. \n\nInterviewer: It sounds like there are several factors at play. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me, Leah. It\u2019s important to acknowledge these barriers. Are there any resources or support systems you think might help you feel more comfortable seeking care if you needed it in the future? \n\nPersona: Honestly, I\u2019m not sure what resources are out there. I hear about some programs, but I don\u2019t know how to access them. I think if there were more information available or if there were local support groups, that might help. Just knowing what\u2019s out there would make a difference. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s a great insight. Having access to information and support can really empower individuals to take charge of their health. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add about your health or experiences that we haven\u2019t covered?\n\nPersona: I think we\u2019ve covered a lot, but I just hope that more people like me can find the help they need, especially in rural areas. It can feel really isolating not knowing where to go for support. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for expressing that concern, Leah. Your thoughts are very important, and I appreciate you being open during this interview. If you have any questions or need support in the future, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to local resources or healthcare providers.",

      "text": "Persona: Since I haven\u2019t been pregnant, I don\u2019t have any prenatal appointments to describe. But if I were to have them in the future, I imagine they would involve checking in on the health of both me and the baby. I think there would be a lot of questions about my health history, maybe some physical exams, and possibly some tests to monitor the baby\u2019s development. I\u2019d hope that the visits would be regular, maybe once a month or so, especially during the later stages of pregnancy. I think I\u2019d like to have time to ask questions and discuss any concerns I might have, but since I haven\u2019t experienced it, it\u2019s hard to say for sure what it would be like. \n\nInterviewer: That sounds like a thoughtful way to approach it. If you did have prenatal appointments, what kind of questions or concerns do you think you would want to bring up during those visits?\n\nPersona: I think I would want to ask about what to expect during pregnancy, like what changes I might experience in my body and how to maintain my health. I\u2019d also be curious about the different tests and screenings that might be done, and how to prepare for labor and delivery. If I had any specific health concerns or worries, I would want to make sure to bring those up too. It would feel important to have those conversations to feel more prepared and supported. \n\nInterviewer: That\u2019s a great approach to preparing for a potential pregnancy. It\u2019s important to feel informed and supported during such a significant time. Have you thought about how you would prefer to receive information or support regarding pregnancy and maternal health?\n\nPersona: I think I would prefer having a mix of information, like written materials or brochures that I could read at my own pace, along with having a healthcare provider I could talk to face-to-face. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to understand things when you can ask questions right away. I\u2019d also appreciate any resources about local support groups or classes that might help me connect with others who are going through the same experiences. \n\nInterviewer: That sounds like a well-rounded approach to finding information and support. It\u2019s great to hear that you\u2019re thinking about these aspects. Lastly, is there anything you would like to see improved in the healthcare system, particularly for young women like yourself in rural areas?\n\nPersona: I think it would be really helpful to have more accessible resources and information tailored for young women, especially those in rural areas. Maybe more outreach programs that connect people with local healthcare options or even virtual resources that can be accessed easily. It would also be nice if there were more community events focused on health education, so people can learn and ask questions in a comfortable setting. Just making sure that everyone knows what\u2019s out there and how to get it would really make a difference. \n\nInterviewer: Those are valuable suggestions. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and experiences, Leah. Your insights can help shape a better understanding of the needs in healthcare access and support for individuals like you. If you have any further thoughts or if anything comes up after this interview, please feel free to reach out. \n\nPersona: Thank you! I appreciate the opportunity to share my experiences.
