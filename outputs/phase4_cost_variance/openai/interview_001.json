I don't have health insurance right now, so I rely on free community healthcare clinics for my medical needs. \n\nI've had to navigate some challenges when it comes to accessing care, especially when I need to see a doctor or get medications. Sometimes, I have to wait a long time for appointments, and it can be hard to get the help I need, especially with my busy school schedule. Overall, it's been a bit of a struggle, but I'm doing my best to manage it. \n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Samantha. It sounds like you've been facing quite a few challenges.

I remember taking a home pregnancy test after missing my period, and when it came back positive, I just felt a rush of emotions\u2014fear, anxiety, and a bit of excitement too. \n\nAt that time, I wasn't in a stable situation, financially or emotionally, so I knew I had to figure out what to do next. I went to the community clinic for my first appointment because I didn\u2019t have insurance. They were really helpful and provided me with the information I needed, but I still felt lost and stressed about everything.\n\nI ended up deciding not to continue with the pregnancy, which was a really tough choice for me. The clinic staff was supportive during that time, but it was still a lot to handle, especially with everything else going on in my life. \n\nSince then, I've been trying to focus on my health and make sure I'm taking care of myself, but I still struggle with the financial stress and trying to balance school. It\u2019s a lot. \n\nInterviewer: That sounds like a very challenging experience, Samantha. Thank you for being so open about it.

They were the only place I could go since I didn't have insurance, and I was really nervous about how things would go.\n\nWhen I arrived at the clinic, I was greeted by some very compassionate staff members who took the time to listen to my story and my concerns. They provided me with information about my options, which was helpful. However, I did feel a bit overwhelmed by the medical terms and what I was supposed to do next. \n\nThe clinic offered me an ultrasound and scheduled follow-up appointments, which made me feel like I was being taken care of. But I also felt a bit rushed at times because they were so busy. I remember waiting for hours for my appointment, which only added to my anxiety. \n\nOverall, I appreciated the support I received, but I wished I had more time to ask questions and process everything. It felt like there was a lot of information to absorb, and sometimes I just needed someone to sit down with me and explain things in a simpler way. \n\nInterviewer: It\u2019s understandable to feel that way, especially in such a significant moment in your life.

The staff there was really friendly, and I had a nurse practitioner who I saw regularly. She was nice and tried to answer my questions, but sometimes I felt like I was just another patient on her list. \n\nI appreciated her support, but I didn\u2019t feel like I had a strong connection with her. I think part of that was due to the busy environment of the clinic\u2014there were so many people coming in and out, and I often felt rushed through my appointments. \n\nI did have a few moments where I felt comfortable enough to share my worries about my health and the pregnancy, especially when it came to my stress levels and how they might affect everything. But I wish I could have had more one-on-one time to really dive into my concerns and get more personalized advice. \n\nSince I wasn't sure what to expect, I sometimes left feeling like I still had questions that weren\u2019t fully answered, especially when it came to my mental health and how to cope with the stress I was under. \n\nInterviewer: It sounds like you were navigating a lot during that time, and I can understand how wanting a deeper connection with your healthcare provider could help.

Each visit usually started with me checking in at the front desk, and then I'd wait in the waiting area for quite a while\u2014sometimes over an hour. \n\nWhen I finally got called in, the nurse would take my vitals, like my blood pressure and weight, and then I\u2019d wait for the nurse practitioner to come in. During the appointments, she would ask me how I was feeling and if I had any concerns. We\u2019d also go over any lab results or tests I had done, like blood work or the ultrasound.\n\nThe visits would be pretty quick\u2014maybe 15 to 20 minutes. We\u2019d discuss my health and the baby\u2019s development, but I often felt like we skimmed over a lot of important topics. For example, I wanted to know more about how my stress could impact the pregnancy or what resources were available for someone in my financial situation, but I didn\u2019t always feel comfortable bringing those things up in the short time we had. \n\nSometimes, it felt more like a checklist for her than an actual conversation. I would leave feeling relieved that everything was okay, but also a bit confused or anxious about the things I hadn\u2019t said or asked. I really wanted to understand how to take care of myself better during that time, and I wish we had more time to talk about those issues. \n\nInterviewer: It seems like you had a lot on your mind during those visits, and I can see why you would want more time to discuss your concerns.

For example, I was dealing with high stress levels, mostly due to my financial situation and family pressures, which I worried could affect my health and the pregnancy. \n\nI also had some issues with gingivitis that I was trying to manage at the same time, which added to my stress. The clinic staff did address it, but again, I felt rushed during those discussions. They prescribed some mouthwash and encouraged me to keep up with dental hygiene, but I sometimes found it hard to fully understand how to prevent it from getting worse. \n\nAdditionally, I had a couple of bouts of viral sinusitis during that period. The clinic helped me with that too by giving me some recommendations for over-the-counter medications, but I was still concerned about how these issues might impact my overall well-being while pregnant. \n\nOverall, I was just trying to stay on top of everything and do my best to take care of myself, but it was definitely a challenge to balance all those health concerns alongside the pregnancy.",

I wish I had more guidance on what supplements I should be prioritizing, especially since I\u2019m trying to manage my health effectively. \n\nInterviewer: It sounds like you're doing your best to maintain your health, but I understand how challenging it can be to keep track of everything amidst your busy life.

Since I come from a low-income family, sometimes healthy food options are harder to access, and I often have to rely on what\u2019s affordable and available. \n\nI mostly tried to eat fruits and vegetables when I could, but I also found myself eating a lot of quick, convenient meals like ramen or frozen dinners because they were cheaper and easier to make with my busy schedule. I know those aren\u2019t the healthiest options, but it can be tough to prioritize cooking when I have school and everything else going on.\n\nI did make an effort to include things like whole grains and proteins in my meals, and I tried to drink a lot of water. I also made sure to take the prenatal vitamins to help with any gaps in my nutrition. But honestly, I often felt guilty about not being able to eat as healthily as I wanted to, especially knowing how important nutrition is during pregnancy.\n\nI wish I had more guidance on what specific foods would be best for me and the baby, as well as resources to help me afford healthier options. It can be really overwhelming trying to figure it all out on my own. \n\nInterviewer: It sounds like you're aware of the importance of nutrition during pregnancy, but the challenges you're facing make it difficult to meet those goals. Have you had any conversations with your healthcare provider about nutrition, or have you received any specific advice or resources related to healthy eating during pregnancy?",

There were so many emotions\u2014fear about my financial situation and how I would manage everything, but also some excitement about the possibility of becoming a mom.\n\nAs time went on, the stress really took a toll on me. I often felt anxious, especially with the pressure of school, finances, and family issues. I worried about how my stress might affect the pregnancy and the baby, which only added to my feelings of guilt and anxiety. I sometimes felt isolated, too, as I didn't have a strong support system to talk to about what I was experiencing.\n\nI did have moments of joy and connection, especially when I would think about the future and what it might hold. But there were also days when I felt really low and struggled to find motivation to do much of anything. I wished I had more resources for mental health support, especially during such a significant time in my life.\n\nI did try to reach out to friends occasionally, but it was hard for them to understand what I was going through, and I didn\u2019t want to burden them with my worries. I think if I had someone to talk to who understood the challenges of being a young, uninsured pregnant woman, it would have made a big difference for me. \n\nInterviewer: It\u2019s completely understandable to feel that way, especially given everything you\u2019re juggling.

I don\u2019t want to overwhelm them with my worries, so I often keep things to myself.\n\nMy family is also going through a tough time financially, which makes it hard for them to be supportive. They care about me, but they have their own stressors to deal with, and sometimes I feel like I don't want to add to their burdens. \n\nI think one of the hardest parts is feeling isolated. I wish I had someone who could really understand what it's like to be a young woman facing these challenges, especially with being uninsured and trying to figure out my health and pregnancy. \n\nSometimes, I try to find support online through forums or social media groups, where I can connect with others who might be going through similar experiences. That helps a bit, but it\u2019s not the same as having someone in-person who can offer real support. I often find myself wishing for more community resources or programs that could provide emotional support for young pregnant women like me. \n\nInterviewer: It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re navigating a lot on your own, and I can see how valuable a supportive network would be during this time.
