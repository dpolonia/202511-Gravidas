At first, I thought it was just a bad cold or something, 'cause I get those a lot. But then my period was late, and my best friend, Maria, was like, \"Girl, you need to take a test.\" So I got one from the dollar store, and it came back positive. I was\u2026 well, I was pretty freaked out, honestly.\n",

      "text": "Okay, so after I found out, I didn't really know what to do. I was kinda in shock for a bit. Maria, she's been really helpful, told me I needed to see a doctor. Thing is, I don't have insurance, so I couldn't just go anywhere. She helped me find this free clinic, like a community health center, a couple of weeks after I found out.\n\nThe first appointment... it was okay. The place was really crowded, and I had to wait a long time to see the doctor. I think I was there for like, three hours. When I finally saw the doctor, she was nice enough, but she seemed really rushed. She asked me a bunch of questions about my health history and stuff, and then she did a quick exam. She told me I was definitely pregnant and gave me some pamphlets about prenatal care and stuff like that. Honestly, it was a little overwhelming. I felt like she was just going through the motions, you know? She didn't really ask how I was *feeling* about the whole thing, just the medical stuff.\n\nThey scheduled me for another appointment, and I've been going back every few weeks since then. It's the only option I have right now.\n",

      "text": "Well, like I said, the prenatal care is at that free clinic. I don't really have *a* provider, you know? It's like, whoever is available that day. Sometimes I see the same doctor, the one I saw the first time, Dr. Ramirez, but other times it's someone else. I think there are a few different doctors and nurses that work there.\n\nWith Dr. Ramirez, she's alright. She's nice enough, I guess. Like I said, she seems really busy, so our appointments are always pretty quick. She answers my questions if I have them, but I don't really feel like I can ask her *everything*, you know? Like, about how I'm feeling emotionally, or about my worries about money and stuff. I just feel like she's got a million other patients to see.\n\nThe other doctors and nurses\u2026 it's the same thing. They're all doing their jobs, but it doesn't feel very personal. I wish I could have a doctor who knew me, who I could really talk to. But I'm grateful I have somewhere to go, even if it's not perfect.\n",

      "text": "Okay, so I usually go about every three weeks, I think. Sometimes it feels like longer, sometimes shorter, depending on how busy they are.\n\nA typical visit... well, I show up and usually have to wait at least an hour, even if I have an appointment. The waiting room is always packed with people. Then, they call my name and a nurse takes me back. She usually weighs me, takes my blood pressure, and asks me for a urine sample. Sometimes they check my blood, but not every time.\n\nThen I wait again, usually in a little room, until a doctor comes in. They listen to the baby's heartbeat with that Doppler thing, which is always cool to hear. They ask me how I'm feeling, if I've had any problems or concerns. I try to ask questions if I have them, but like I said, they seem rushed. They usually check my belly to see how the baby is growing.\n\nAfter that, they schedule my next appointment and I'm done. It usually takes up a big chunk of my day, with all the waiting and everything. I wish it felt a little more... thorough, I guess. Like, I wish they had more time to talk to me about things besides just the basic medical stuff. Like, I'm worried about how I'm going to afford everything, and how I'm going to balance school and a baby, but I don't really feel comfortable bringing that up.\n",

      "text": "Well, I've had a few things. The morning sickness was really bad at the beginning, like I said. It finally started to get a little better, but sometimes it still comes back. I've also been getting these headaches, like really bad ones, especially when I'm stressed, which is pretty much all the time.\n\nAnd then there's the gingivitis. I've always had problems with my gums, but it's gotten worse since I got pregnant. My gums bleed a lot when I brush my teeth, and they're really sore. I told Dr. Ramirez about it, and she said it's common during pregnancy because of the hormones, and that I should just brush and floss more. But it's hard to keep up with when I'm so tired and stressed.\n\nI also got a sinus infection a few weeks ago. It was awful. My head was pounding, and I was so congested. I went to the clinic, and they said it was viral, so they just told me to rest and drink fluids. It eventually went away, but it took a while.\n\nOther than that... I think that's it. I'm mostly just tired all the time, and stressed about everything.\n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing. I understand that you're experiencing a lot. You mentioned headaches, gingivitis, and a sinus infection. Have any of these issues been difficult to manage, or have they impacted your daily life significantly?\n",

      "text": "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing. I understand that you're experiencing a lot. You mentioned headaches, gingivitis, and a sinus infection. Have any of these issues been difficult to manage, or have they impacted your daily life significantly?\nPersona: Yeah, definitely. The headaches are the worst. They make it really hard to concentrate in class, and sometimes I have to miss school altogether. I try to take Tylenol, but it doesn't always help, and I don't want to take too much of it. Plus, the stress makes them even worse, so it's like a vicious cycle.\n\nThe gingivitis is just annoying and painful. It makes it hard to eat sometimes, especially crunchy stuff. And I'm self-conscious about it, you know? I don't want people to think I don't take care of myself. I try to brush and floss like the doctor said, but it's hard to be consistent when I'm so tired.\n\nThe sinus infection was just miserable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't sleep, and I felt like my head was going to explode. I had to miss a few days of school because of it, and I fell behind on my assignments. I was so worried about getting even more behind.\n\nSo yeah, they've all definitely made things harder. It's just one thing after another, you know? It feels like my body is just falling apart.\n\nInterviewer: What medications or supplements are you currently taking?\nPersona: Well, besides the Tylenol for my headaches, I'm supposed to be taking prenatal vitamins. Dr. Ramirez gave me a prescription for them at my first appointment. But... I haven't been very good about taking them consistently. They're kind of expensive, and sometimes I forget to pick them up from the pharmacy. I try to take them when I remember, but it's not every day, I'll admit that.\n\nOther than that, I'm not taking anything else regularly. I sometimes take cold medicine if I feel like I'm getting sick, but that's about it.\n",

      "text": "My diet... well, it's not the greatest, to be honest. Like I said, money is tight, so I mostly eat whatever is cheap and easy. Lots of ramen noodles, mac and cheese, stuff like that. I try to eat some fruits and vegetables when I can, but they're expensive, so it's not always possible.\n\nI know I should be eating healthier now that I'm pregnant, but it's hard. I crave a lot of junk food, like chips and candy. And sometimes I'm just too tired to cook a proper meal. I know it's bad, but I just do the best I can with what I have.\n\nI try to drink water, but I also drink a lot of soda. I know, I know, it's terrible for me, but it's just... comforting, I guess. I probably don't eat enough protein either. I should probably be eating more meat, but it's so expensive.\n\nDr. Ramirez gave me some information about healthy eating during pregnancy, but it's hard to follow when I'm worried about paying rent and getting to class on time. I just wish I had more resources to eat better.\n",

      "text": "Emotionally... it's been a rollercoaster, honestly. At first, I was just terrified. I didn't plan this, and I didn't know how I was going to handle it. I felt so overwhelmed and alone.\n\nThen, sometimes, I get really excited about the baby. I start thinking about holding her, and what she'll look like, and all that. It's a nice feeling, but then the fear comes back, because I don't know if I can be a good mom.\n\nI'm also really stressed about money. I don't know how I'm going to afford all the things a baby needs. Diapers, formula, clothes... it all adds up so fast. I'm trying to work as much as I can, but it's hard when I'm tired and nauseous.\n\nMy family... they're trying to be supportive, but they're also stressed about their own stuff. My mom keeps telling me I need to quit school and get a \"real job,\" but I don't want to give up on my education. It's the only way I'm going to get out of this situation.\n\nSo yeah, I'm mostly just stressed, scared, and tired. I have moments of happiness, but they're usually overshadowed by everything else. I wish I had someone to talk to, someone who really understood what I was going through. But I don't really have anyone like that.\n\nInterviewer: You mentioned not having someone to talk to. Do you have any support systems in place, such as friends, family, or community groups, to help you during this time?\n",

      "text": "Interviewer: You mentioned not having someone to talk to. Do you have any support systems in place, such as friends, family, or community groups, to help you during this time?\nPersona: Well, Maria, my best friend, she's been really supportive. She's the one who made me take the pregnancy test in the first place, and she's been helping me find resources and stuff. She doesn't have kids herself, but she's been trying to be there for me as much as she can. I can talk to her about some things, but she doesn't really understand the whole \"being pregnant\" thing, you know?\n\nMy mom... she's trying, but she's got her own problems. She works a lot, and she's always stressed about money too. She tells me I should have been more careful, which I know, but it doesn't really help now. She'll help me with the baby when it comes, I think, but she's not really someone I can talk to about my feelings.\n\nMy dad... he's not really in the picture. He left when I was little, so I don't really have any contact with him.\n\nSo yeah, Maria is really my main support. I don't really know anyone else who's pregnant or has kids, and I don't really have time to go to any support groups or anything like that. I just feel kind of alone, most of the time.\n\nInterviewer: Who supports you during your pregnancy? Can you tell me about your support network?\nPersona: I think I mostly covered that in the last answer. Maria is my biggest support. She helps me with practical stuff, like finding resources and going to appointments with me sometimes. She also lets me vent to her when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nMy mom is supportive in her own way. She's promised to help me with the baby once it's born, which I'm really grateful for. But she's not really someone I can confide in emotionally.\n\nSo, yeah, my support network is pretty small. It's mostly just Maria and my mom, but they both have their own lives and problems, so I try not to burden them too much. I wish I had a bigger support system, but I don't really know how to find one.\n",
