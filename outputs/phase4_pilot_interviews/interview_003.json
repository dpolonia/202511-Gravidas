I'm single and live in an urban area. My income is middle-class, and I'm covered by my employer's health insurance. I try to stay health-conscious, though I admit I could exercise more often. I manage chronic asthma with medication, and I've had some stress due to my job and personal life. I also had a bout of acute infective cystitis recently, but that's been treated.\n\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Lila. It sounds like you manage a lot with your job and health.

It was a bit of a surprise because I was using an IUD for contraception, but these things can happen, I suppose. I learned I was pregnant when I missed my period and took a home pregnancy test, which came back positive. I then went to my doctor to confirm the pregnancy.\n\nInterviewer: I'm sorry to hear about your miscarriage, Lila. That must have been difficult. Can you tell me about the care you received during that time? Were you satisfied with the prenatal care you received before the miscarriage?",

The experience was a bit overwhelming, to be honest. It was my first time being pregnant, and even though it was early, there was a lot of information to take in. My doctor did an ultrasound and some blood work to confirm the pregnancy and check my hormone levels. They also discussed my medical history, including my asthma, and how it might affect the pregnancy. Overall, the care was good, but because of the miscarriage, I didn't get to experience much of the prenatal care process. It was cut short, and that was really hard for me.\n\nInterviewer: I can understand how that must have felt, Lila. It sounds like you received prompt and thorough care initially. Can you tell me more about the support you received after the miscarriage? Were there any resources or follow-up care provided that you found helpful or lacking?",

After the miscarriage, Dr. Martin was very supportive. She made sure to follow up with me a few weeks later to see how I was doing emotionally and physically. She offered resources on grief counseling and support groups for women who have experienced miscarriage, which I found really helpful. I appreciated her checking in on me, but I felt there could have been more information provided upfront about what to expect after a miscarriage, both emotionally and physically. It was a challenging time, and having more guidance might have helped me navigate it better.",

But during the brief time I was pregnant, I had an appointment scheduled every four weeks. A typical visit involved checking my weight, blood pressure, and sometimes urine. Dr. Martin would ask about any symptoms or concerns I had, and we'd discuss how I was feeling overall. She would also listen to the baby's heartbeat, which was really emotional for me, knowing I was going to lose the pregnancy. We talked about my asthma and how to manage it safely during pregnancy.

My doctor mentioned that sometimes these things happen without a clear cause, but they did all the necessary tests to rule out any underlying issues that might have contributed to it.

I was particularly mindful of getting enough folic acid, which my doctor emphasized was important for the baby's development. I also drank a lot of water and tried to limit my caffeine intake, sticking mostly to herbal teas. However, with my work as a social worker, sometimes I had to rely on quick meals or snacks, which weren't always the healthiest options. My doctor and I discussed my diet during my prenatal visits, and she gave me some tips on how to make better choices even when I was short on time. \n\nInterviewer: It sounds like you made a concerted effort to eat healthily despite your busy schedule.

It was difficult to process, and I struggled with feelings of guilt and wondering if there was something I could have done differently. Dr. Martin was very supportive, and the resources she provided, like the grief counseling and support groups, were really helpful. They allowed me to connect with others who had gone through similar experiences, which made me feel less alone.

My family lives out of state, but they were supportive over the phone and offered to come visit if I needed them. At work, my supervisor was understanding and allowed me some flexibility in my schedule, which helped a lot. I also found the support group for women who had experienced miscarriages to be a vital part of my support system.

I was leaning towards a natural birth if possible, but I knew I wanted to be open to medical interventions if they were necessary for my health or the baby's health. I also thought about having my friend Sarah with me for support during labor, as she was my main support person.

Initially, I relied a lot on the internet, reading articles on reputable websites like the Mayo Clinic and WebMD. I also found some pregnancy apps useful; they provided weekly updates on what was happening with my baby and tips on what to expect. My OB-GYN, Dr. Martin, was a primary source of information too. She gave me pamphlets and recommended some books on pregnancy and childbirth, like \"What to Expect When You're Expecting.\" I also joined an online forum for expectant mothers, which was helpful for getting firsthand experiences and advice from other women. After the miscarriage, the support group I attended provided a lot of emotional support and practical information about coping with loss. If I were to get pregnant again, I'd probably use these same resources and maybe look into childbirth education classes to get more in-depth knowledge.",

I did start thinking about how I would manage financially if I were to have a baby. My income is middle-class, so I knew I would need to budget carefully. I considered setting up a savings plan for baby-related expenses like diapers, clothing, and eventually, childcare. I also looked into potential maternity leave benefits from my job, which would have been crucial for managing my time off work. Thankfully, I didn't have to go through with those preparations due to the miscarriage, but it was a reminder of how important it is to be financially prepared.
