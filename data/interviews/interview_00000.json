I really appreciate your willingness to participate in this research. \n\nBefore we dive in, I want you to know that this is a safe, confidential space. There are no wrong answers here\u2014I'm just trying to understand your experiences and what you're going through. If any question feels too personal or you'd rather not answer, just let me know and we can skip it. Does that sound okay?\n\n---\n\nLet me start with some foundational questions to help me understand your situation better.\n\n**First, I'd like to confirm: You're currently pregnant, correct? And this is your first pregnancy?** How far along are you, if you don't mind me asking?\n\nAnd then I'm curious\u2014**how are you feeling about the pregnancy overall?** I know from your background information that you mentioned being uncertain about your pregnancy plans. I'd like to hear more about that in your own words, if you're comfortable sharing.\n\nTake your time with your responses. There's no rush.",

Well, like I said, I'm 24, and I work as a manager at a retail store here in the suburbs\u2014it's not glamorous or anything, but it pays the bills, mostly. I'm engaged to my fianc\u00e9; we've been together for about four years now, so that's... that's good, I guess.\n\n*fidgets with hands*\n\nAs for the pregnancy\u2014yes, I'm pregnant. This is my first one. I'm about 16 weeks along now, so I'm in my second trimester. And honestly? *pauses, looking down* I'm... I'm still processing it all. We weren't exactly planning this right now. Don't get me wrong, my fianc\u00e9 is supportive, but we haven't set a wedding date yet, and I'm still figuring out if I'm ready to be a mom, you know? There's a lot going on.\n\n*looks up*\n\nAs for my life situation\u2014I mean, we're doing okay financially, but it's tight. I don't have health insurance through work, so I've been going to the free clinic when I really need to. My fianc\u00e9 has some coverage, but it's not great. We live in a decent apartment, nothing fancy. I smoke sometimes when I'm stressed\u2014I know that's probably not great, especially now\u2014and I'm not super active. I know I should be, but between work and everything else...\n\n*trails off*\n\nIs there anything specific you want to know?",

I missed my period, and at first I just thought, you know, maybe it was late or stress or whatever. But then I started feeling really tired\u2014like, exhausted all the time\u2014and my boobs were tender. So I picked up a pregnancy test at the drugstore, did it at home, and... there it was. Two lines.\n\n*laughs nervously*\n\nI remember just staring at it for like five minutes, not really believing it. I called my fianc\u00e9 right away, and he came home from work early. We just kind of sat there in shock for a while, honestly.\n\n*shifts in seat*\n\nI didn't go to the clinic right away because, I don't know, I was still trying to process it myself. But then I went in about a week later because I wanted to confirm it was real and get some information. That's when they did the blood test and everything, and yeah, it's definitely real. I'm about 16 weeks now based on what they calculated from my last period.\n\n*looks down at hands*\n\nThe thing is, I haven't really told many people yet. Just my fianc\u00e9 and my mom. And I haven't... I haven't started taking prenatal vitamins or anything like that. I know I probably should, but I'm still kind of in denial, I think.

I wasn't sure where else to go, honestly. I don't have insurance, and I knew the free clinic wouldn't turn me away.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nThe experience was... okay, I mean. The staff was nice enough, not judgmental or anything. They did a pregnancy test to confirm, took some basic information, asked about my medical history. They gave me some pamphlets about prenatal care and nutrition, stuff like that. \n\n*fidgets with hands*\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014it felt kind of rushed, you know? I was only there for maybe 20 minutes total. They didn't really go into a lot of detail about what to expect or answer a lot of my questions. I had questions, but I felt like I was holding up the line or something. And they mentioned I should be taking prenatal vitamins, but they didn't really explain *why* or help me figure out how to get them affordably.\n\n*looks up*\n\nSince then, I haven't been back. I know I probably should schedule another appointment, but... *trails off* I guess I'm not sure what to expect, and honestly, it's hard to get time off work. Plus, I'm still kind of uncertain about everything, so part of me is like, why go if I'm not even sure I'm keeping it?\n\n*pauses, realizing what she said*\n\nI mean... I don't know.

It's whoever is available when I go in, which I know isn't ideal. The last time I was there, I saw a nurse practitioner, I think? Or maybe a physician's assistant\u2014I'm honestly not totally sure. She was nice, but like I said, the visit was pretty quick.\n\n*rubs face tiredly*\n\nI don't really have a \"relationship\" with a healthcare provider, if I'm being honest. It's more like... I go in when I need something, they help me, and then I leave. There's no continuity or anything. I don't know if I'll see the same person next time I go back.\n\n*looks down*\n\nAnd that's part of why I haven't gone back yet, I think. If I had someone I could call with questions or someone who knew my situation and could help me figure things out, that might be different. But calling the free clinic just feels like... I don't know, like I'm taking up resources that someone else might need more?\n\n*pauses*\n\nMy mom keeps telling me I should try to find an OB or at least get set up with someone regular, but I don't know how to do that without insurance. And honestly, I'm worried about the cost. Even if I could find someone, what if I can't afford it?\n\n*looks up at interviewer*\n\nIs that something you see a lot with people in my situation?",

And then more often as I get further along? But nobody really sat down and explained that to me clearly. The nurse practitioner or whoever it was just kind of said, \"Make an appointment for next month,\" but she didn't give me a specific date or anything. It was all pretty vague.\n\n*looks frustrated*\n\nAnd honestly, I've been putting it off. Work has been crazy, and I'm still just... I'm still wrapping my head around all of this.

I've had some nausea, especially in the mornings, though it's gotten a bit better in the last week or so.\n\n*shifts in seat*\n\nI've also noticed I'm getting headaches more often than I used to, and my sinuses have been acting up.

I know babies are expensive, and honestly, the thought of trying to afford all that stuff on top of everything else just makes me feel even more overwhelmed and panicked.\n\n*looks down*\n\nMy mom has offered to help buy some things, and I think my fianc\u00e9's family might chip in too, but I don't want to ask for help. It feels like admitting that I can't handle this on my own, you know?\n\n*pauses, looking genuinely worried*\n\nI don't even know where to start with the financial stuff. Should I be looking into assistance programs or something? Is there help available for people in my situation?",

I'm already worried about what's going to happen when I do tell them.\n\n*rubs arms nervously*\n\nI work retail management, which means I'm on my feet a lot, dealing with customers, doing inventory, opening and closing the store. It's physically demanding, and with how exhausted I am all the time, it's getting harder. Like, by the end of my shift, my feet are killing me and I'm just completely drained.\n\n*pauses*\n\nI haven't taken any time off for appointments yet because I've only had the one clinic visit, and I didn't want to draw attention to anything. But I know I'm going to need to start scheduling regular prenatal appointments, and that means I'm going to have to either ask for time off or figure out how to work around it. And I'm worried about how my manager is going to react.\n\n*looks uncertain*\n\nI don't know what my rights are as a pregnant employee, honestly. Like, can they fire me for being pregnant? Can they cut my hours? I've heard stories about people losing their jobs after getting pregnant, and that terrifies me because I need this job. I need the income.\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nAnd then there's the whole maternity leave thing. I don't know if I get any, or if it's paid, or how long I can take off. I haven't even looked into it because that would mean admitting this is really happening and I'm going to have to deal with all these logistics.\n\n*looks at interviewer*\n\nI'm basically just trying to keep my head down and not think about it until I absolutely have to.",

That feels even further away than the birth itself, you know?\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nI mean, intellectually, I know that after I give birth, there's going to be a baby that I have to take care of. Like, I know babies need to eat and sleep and have their diapers changed and all that. But I haven't really... I don't know, made any actual plans or thought through what that's going to look like for me.\n\n*rubs face tiredly*\n\nI guess I haven't thought about things like... how long I can take off work, what childcare is going to look like, how I'm going to afford daycare if I go back to work. My fianc\u00e9 and I haven't really talked about whether one of us would stay home or if we'd both be working. We haven't talked about any of it, really.\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nAnd honestly? I'm terrified about the actual recovery part too. I've heard that postpartum recovery is rough\u2014like, painful and exhausting and emotional. And I'm already not in a great headspace mentally. I'm worried about postpartum depression or just... not being able to handle it all.\n\n*looks down at hands*\n\nMy mom has mentioned that she could help out, maybe come stay with us for a bit after the baby is born, but I haven't asked her to or made any concrete plans. It's all just kind of... floating out there in the distance, and I'm not ready to think about it yet.\n\n*pauses, looking vulnerable*\n\nI feel like I'm supposed to have all this figured out by now, but I don't have any of it figured out.

I already feel pretty guilty about a lot of this stuff, so... yeah.\n\n*pauses at the door, looking back*\n\nI hope this information is helpful for whatever research you're doing. And I guess... I don't know, maybe talking about it like this will help me actually start dealing with things instead of just avoiding them all the time.\n\n*manages a small smile*\n\nMy mom's always saying I need to be more proactive about my health and my future, and I guess she's right. I just... I need to figure out how to get past this denial thing, you know?\n\n*extends hand for a handshake*\n\nThanks again.
