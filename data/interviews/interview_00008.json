What's been going on in your life recently, particularly around your pregnancy?**\n\nI noticed from your health records that this is your first pregnancy. How are you feeling about that overall?

I'm 29, been working as a cashier at the local grocery store for about five years now. It's part-time work, so the income's not always steady, but we get by. My husband and I have been married for three years now, and we live here in Beckley\u2014been here my whole life, pretty much.\n\n*pauses, looking down at hands*\n\nAs for the pregnancy... I found out about two months ago. It was kind of a shock, to be honest. We weren't exactly planning it, but we weren't preventing it either, if that makes sense? My husband was excited right away, but I've been... I don't know, uncertain about it all. There's a lot going through my head.\n\n*fidgets slightly*\n\nLife's been pretty stressful lately. Work can be demanding\u2014dealing with customers, the scheduling is unpredictable. And honestly, I feel kind of isolated sometimes out here. A lot of my friends have moved away, and my family situation is complicated. My husband's been supportive, but he works long hours too, so we don't always have time to talk things through.\n\n*looks up*\n\nI have Medicaid, which is good because I don't know how we'd afford all this otherwise. I've had my regular checkups\u2014I'm pretty good about that usually, even with my asthma. But with the pregnancy... I haven't really started prenatal vitamins yet. I know I probably should, but I'm just... still processing everything, I guess.\n\nIs that the kind of information you were looking for?",

I'd been feeling a little off\u2014tired, nauseous in the mornings\u2014and I just thought maybe it was stress or something with my asthma acting up. I wasn't really thinking pregnancy.\n\n*rubs arms*\n\nBut then I was late, and my husband suggested I take a test. I was skeptical at first, but... yeah, it came back positive. I took two actually, just to be sure. And then I made an appointment with my doctor to confirm it.\n\n*pauses, looking uncertain*\n\nThis is my first pregnancy\u2014my first time going through anything like this. So honestly, I didn't really know what to expect. I'm still kind of... wrapping my head around it all, you know?\n\n*fidgets with hands*\n\nThe timing just feels complicated. With my job being part-time and the income being unpredictable, and with everything else going on... I guess I'm still trying to figure out if I'm ready for this. My husband's on board, but it's me who has to go through it all, and sometimes that feels overwhelming.\n\n*looks at interviewer*\n\nI know I should probably be more excited or prepared by now, but I'm just being honest\u2014I'm still uncertain about a lot of things. Is that normal? Do other women feel this way when they find out?",

That was probably about a week after I found out. I have a regular doctor I see for my asthma checkups, so I called them first.\n\n*frowns slightly*\n\nThe appointment took a while to get\u2014I think it was about three weeks out. They were pretty busy. When I finally went in, the doctor confirmed everything, did some basic stuff, asked me questions about my medical history, my family history, that kind of thing. They talked about my asthma and made sure my medications were safe during pregnancy, which was good to know.\n\n*pauses, looking a bit hesitant*\n\nBut honestly? The experience felt kind of... rushed, I guess? The appointment was maybe 20 minutes total. They gave me some pamphlets about prenatal care and mentioned vitamins, but nobody really sat down and explained things to me in detail. I had questions, but I felt like they were busy and I didn't want to hold things up.\n\n*looks down*\n\nThey did mention I should start prenatal vitamins with folic acid, and they scheduled me for an ultrasound and some lab work. But I haven't actually filled the vitamin prescription yet. Part of it is the cost\u2014I wasn't sure if my Medicaid would cover it\u2014and part of it is just...

But he's not an OB-GYN or anything\u2014he's just a general practitioner.\n\n*fidgets with the hem of her shirt*\n\nI mean, he's handling my prenatal care so far, but honestly, I'm not entirely sure if that's the best setup. He referred me to get an ultrasound done at the hospital, and they mentioned something about potentially seeing a midwife or an OB down the road, but nothing's been scheduled yet. It's all kind of unclear to me.\n\n*looks uncertain*\n\nAs for my relationship with him... I don't know. He's competent, I think. But like I said, the appointments feel rushed. I don't feel like there's a lot of time to really talk through my concerns or my uncertainty about the pregnancy. He seems more focused on the medical checklist\u2014vitamins, tests, that sort of thing\u2014rather than, like, how I'm actually feeling about all this emotionally.\n\n*pauses*\n\nAnd I guess part of me is wondering if I should be seeing someone who specializes in pregnancy?

I have the appointment card somewhere, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact date off the top of my head.\n\n*rubs face tiredly*\n\nAs for what a typical visit is like... honestly, based on that first one, I'm not sure what \"typical\" even looks like yet. But let me walk you through what happened:\n\n*counts on fingers*\n\nI checked in at the front desk, waited maybe 15 minutes in the waiting room. Then a nurse took me back, checked my blood pressure, weight, asked some basic questions about how I was feeling. That was maybe five minutes. Then Dr. Patterson came in, asked me a bunch of questions about my medical history, family history, whether I was taking any medications besides my asthma inhaler.\n\n*pauses*\n\nHe did a physical exam\u2014checked my abdomen, listened to my heart and lungs. Asked about my asthma symptoms, made sure I was still using my inhaler correctly. Then he talked about the vitamins again, mentioned I need to avoid certain things, gave me those pamphlets.\n\n*looks down*\n\nHe ordered lab work and the ultrasound, wrote down some referrals, and then... that was pretty much it. The whole thing felt like maybe 20, 25 minutes tops.\n\n*looks up with concern*\n\nI'm not sure if that's normal or if I should be getting more time and attention?

It was really uncomfortable and kind of scary because I wasn't sure if it would affect the baby.\n\n*rubs lower abdomen*\n\nI called Dr. Patterson's office about it, and they got me in pretty quickly, which was good.

I've had the nausea I mentioned, especially in the mornings. Some days it's worse than others. I'm tired a lot too\u2014like, exhausted. I can barely get through my shift at work sometimes.

I'm not entirely sure, to be honest.\n\n*rubs back of neck*\n\nFor my asthma, I take an albuterol inhaler\u2014the rescue inhaler\u2014when I need it. I don't have a daily controller medication right now because my asthma has been pretty well-controlled. Dr. Patterson checked on that at my prenatal appointment and said the albuterol should be fine to keep using during pregnancy, so that's good.\n\n*counts on fingers*\n\nI think that's... that's actually it. I'm not on any other medications or supplements. No blood pressure meds or anything like that.

My husband and I try to cook when we can, but between his work schedule and mine, it's not always consistent. We do a lot of pasta, chicken, stuff that's easy to throw together.

I know I'm supposed to be preparing, but every time I think about the cost of all that stuff, I just... I don't know where to start. Diapers alone seem expensive, and then there's formula if I can't breastfeed, and car seats, and...\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nI have Medicaid, which covers the pregnancy and delivery, which is huge. I don't know what we'd do without it. But I'm not sure what else it covers\u2014like, do they cover the baby's care after birth? Do they cover formula if I need it?\n\n*pauses*\n\nWe've talked a little about me taking maternity leave, but I'm not sure if my part-time job even offers that. And if I'm not working, we lose that income, which is already tight. My husband might be able to pick up extra hours, but that means he'd be working even more.\n\n*looks overwhelmed*\n\nI haven't really looked into childcare costs either, but I'm pretty sure that's going to be expensive. Like, eventually I'd want to go back to work, but if childcare costs more than I make...\n\n*meets interviewer's eyes*\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure how we're going to make this work financially. Have I missed something? Are there resources or assistance programs I should know about?",

      "text": "*sighs heavily and leans back in chair*\n\nOh, that's... that's been complicated, honestly.\n\n*pauses, choosing words carefully*\n\nSo, like I mentioned, I work part-time as a cashier at the grocery store. The hours are unpredictable\u2014some weeks I get 20 hours, some weeks maybe 30. It depends on how busy they are and what the scheduling looks like. That inconsistency has always been stressful, but now with the pregnancy...\n\n*rubs temples*\n\nPhysically, it's been harder. I'm on my feet for most of my shift, and between the fatigue and the nausea, some days I just feel wiped out. There was one day last week where I felt so dizzy I almost passed out at the register. That scared me\u2014I was worried about what that meant for the baby.\n\n*looks down*\n\nAnd then there's the mental side of it. I'm constantly worried about what's going to happen when I start showing more, or when I need time off for appointments. My manager is... okay, I guess, but I'm not sure how understanding he'll be about needing flexibility.\n\n*fidgets*\n\nI haven't officially told my work yet that I'm pregnant. Part of me is worried they'll treat me differently or try to cut my hours. I know that's probably not legal or whatever, but I'm not sure what my rights are, and I don't want to rock the boat, you know?\n\n*looks up with concern*\n\nAnd then there's the bigger question\u2014what happens after the baby is born? I need to work because we need the income, but I also need to be there for the baby. I don't even know what maternity leave looks like for part-time employees. Do I even get any? How long? Will my job be there when I come back?\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nI haven't really talked to anyone at work about any of this. I'm kind of just... trying to keep my head down and get through each day right now.\n\n*meets interviewer's eyes*\n\nShould I be doing something about this? Like, should I be talking to my manager or HR or something?",

The postpartum stuff feels even further away and more overwhelming.\n\n*pauses, looking uncertain*\n\nI mean, I know intellectually that I'm going to have a baby and then I'm going to have to... take care of it, you know? But as far as actual planning? I haven't really thought that through.\n\n*fidgets with hands*\n\nI guess I'm assuming I'll be home for a little bit after birth, but like I said, I'm not even sure what my maternity leave situation is. And then what? Do I go back to work right away? Do I try to find childcare? I don't even know where I'd look for that out here.\n\n*looks worried*\n\nAnd then there's the whole... postpartum recovery thing. I don't really know what to expect. Like, how long does it take to recover? What am I supposed to do during that time? Can I be alone with the baby, or do I need help?\n\n*rubs back of neck*\n\nMy husband will be around, I think. He said he'd try to take some time off work, but I'm not sure for how long. And like I mentioned, my family support isn't really there. So it would basically be me and my husband figuring it out.\n\n*meets interviewer's eyes with concern*\n\nI haven't thought about breastfeeding versus formula, or... I don't know, sleep schedules or any of that stuff. Should I be thinking about this already? Is there someone who's supposed to be helping me plan for all this?\n\n*pauses*\n\nHonestly, I feel like there's so much I don't know and no one's really explaining it to me.",

It's made me think about some things I probably should be addressing\u2014like the prenatal vitamins, and maybe I need to talk to Dr. Patterson more, or find someone who specializes in pregnancy.\n\n*pauses, looking thoughtful*\n\nAnd maybe I should be looking into some of those resources you might have mentioned... or that I should be looking for.
