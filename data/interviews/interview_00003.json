I really appreciate your willingness to participate in this research. \n\nBefore we dive in, I want you to know that this is a safe, confidential space. There are no judgment calls here\u2014I'm just trying to understand your experiences and what you're going through so we can better support young people like you.\n\nLet me start with something foundational:\n\n**How are you feeling today? And how are you doing with your pregnancy so far?**\n\nI know this might be a lot to process, especially if this is new for you, so I want to start by just hearing where you're at emotionally and physically right now.\n\n---\n\n*[I'm settling in, maintaining an open, attentive posture, ready to listen and take notes as needed]*",

I graduated high school last year, but I'm not really in school right now. I'm kind of between things, I guess. Job-wise, I mean. I've done some part-time stuff here and there, but nothing steady, so money's pretty tight.\n\n*[She glances down at her hands]*\n\nI live with my parents in the suburbs here\u2014northwest of Chicago. It's... it's okay, but there's a lot going on at home. My parents are supportive, but they're also stressed about bills and everything, so finding out I'm pregnant was... yeah. It was a lot.\n\n*[She pauses, then continues more quietly]*\n\nI'm single. The guy and I aren't together anymore. We weren't really serious, and when I told him, he kind of just... disappeared. So I'm dealing with this mostly on my own, which is scary.\n\n*[She looks up briefly]*\n\nI don't have health insurance. I've been going to the free clinic when I need something, but it's hard because you have to wait forever, and sometimes they're not open when I can get there. I smoke\u2014I know I probably shouldn't, especially now\u2014and I'm just... I'm not really sure what I'm doing, honestly. This whole pregnancy thing wasn't planned, and I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do.\n\n*[She fidgets with her sleeve]*\n\nIs that... is that what you needed to know?",

I missed my period, and at first I was like, \"okay, maybe it's just late,\" but then I kept feeling weird. Nauseous, tired all the time, my boobs were sore. I was at a friend's house and she had a pregnancy test, so I just... I took it. And it was positive.\n\n*[She wraps her arms around herself]*\n\nI didn't tell anyone for like two weeks after that. I was just kind of in denial, I guess. I kept thinking maybe it was wrong, or maybe it would just go away on its own. But then I knew I had to tell someone, so I told my mom first. She cried, but not in like, a super angry way. More like... worried? My dad was quieter about it. They want to help, but they're also stressed because they're already struggling financially.\n\n*[She looks down at her lap]*\n\nI went to the free clinic after that to confirm it, and they did an ultrasound and told me I'm about 9 weeks now. So this is my first pregnancy\u2014I've never been pregnant before. And honestly, I'm still kind of processing it all.\n\n*[She hesitates]*\n\nThe clinic gave me some paperwork about prenatal vitamins and stuff, but I haven't really... I haven't started taking them yet. I know I probably should, but I've just been so overwhelmed and confused about what I even want to do. Like, I don't know if I'm keeping it, putting it up for adoption, or... \n\n*[Her voice trails off]*\n\nI'm sorry, I know that probably sounds bad.",

I was really nervous going in. I didn't know what to expect, and I was worried they'd judge me or something.\n\n*[She picks at a thread on her sleeve]*\n\nThe wait was really long. I got there early in the morning, and I didn't see anyone until like two hours later. But when I finally got called back, the nurse was actually really nice. She didn't make me feel bad or anything. She asked me a bunch of questions about my health history, when my last period was, all that stuff.\n\n*[She pauses, remembering]*\n\nThe ultrasound was... weird but also kind of cool? Like, seeing the baby on the screen. That made it feel more real, you know? The technician didn't say much, but she confirmed I'm about 9 weeks along.\n\n*[Her expression becomes more uncertain]*\n\nThe thing is, after that first visit, I haven't really gone back. They gave me information about coming back for more appointments and stuff, and they talked about prenatal vitamins and not smoking, but... \n\n*[She trails off, looking a bit guilty]*\n\nI haven't made another appointment. Part of it is that it's hard to get there\u2014no car, relying on buses or my parents. And part of it is just... I'm still so unsure about everything. Like, why start all these appointments and prenatal care if I'm not even sure I'm going to continue the pregnancy?\n\n*[She looks up at you]*\n\nIs that... is that bad?

I've been there a couple times for other stuff before\u2014like when I had that concussion last year\u2014so I kind of knew where it was.\n\n*[She speaks a bit more openly]*\n\nThe nurse I saw for my pregnancy confirmation was really good, actually. Her name was... I think it was Ms. Rodriguez? She was patient and didn't make me feel rushed. She explained things clearly and didn't talk down to me, which I appreciated. She asked about my living situation, my support system, whether I felt safe at home\u2014stuff like that. It felt like she actually cared, not just like she was checking boxes.\n\n*[Her expression becomes more hesitant]*\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014I don't know if I'll see the same person next time, or if there even will be a next time soon. That's kind of the problem with the free clinic. It's not like I have a regular doctor who knows me and my whole situation. It's whoever's available that day. So it's hard to build like, a real relationship with someone.\n\n*[She fidgets with her hands]*\n\nAnd honestly? I've been dealing with anxiety for a while\u2014like, untreated anxiety\u2014and I haven't really talked to anyone at the clinic about that in relation to the pregnancy. I don't know if I should bring it up, or if they'd even be able to help with that.\n\n*[She looks at you]*\n\nDo you think I need to find a specific OB or something?

I've only had the one appointment\u2014the initial confirmation visit at the free clinic. So I don't really have a \"typical\" visit yet because I haven't established a regular schedule.\n\n*[She looks down, a bit sheepish]*\n\nI know I'm supposed to go back. The clinic gave me paperwork that said something about coming back in like 4 weeks, and then more frequently as I get further along. But I haven't actually scheduled anything since that first visit.\n\n*[She shifts uncomfortably]*\n\nI guess I've been kind of... avoiding it? Which I know isn't great. It's like, part of me is still hoping that if I don't go to more appointments, I won't have to fully commit to any decision about the pregnancy. That sounds dumb when I say it out loud, but that's kind of where my head's at.\n\n*[She speaks more quietly]*\n\nFrom what I remember from that first visit, they did the ultrasound, took some blood I think, asked me a bunch of health questions. The whole thing took maybe an hour with the wait time included. But I don't really know what to expect from future appointments\u2014like, what they'll check, how long they'll take, or if they'll keep pushing the prenatal vitamins and telling me to quit smoking.\n\n*[She looks up at you]*\n\nDo you think... do you think I should go ahead and schedule another appointment?

But there are definitely things going on.\n\n*[She counts on her fingers]*\n\nSo physically, I've been really nauseous\u2014like, especially in the mornings, but sometimes all day. I'm exhausted all the time, even when I sleep a lot. My boobs are sore. And I've been having some cramping on and off, which kind of freaks me out because I don't know if that's normal or if something's wrong.\n\n*[She looks a bit worried]*\n\nI haven't asked anyone about the cramping yet because I didn't want to go back to the clinic unless it was like, an emergency. But now I'm wondering if I should have mentioned it.\n\n*[She shifts in her seat]*\n\nThe other thing is... I mean, my anxiety has been really bad. Like, worse than usual. I'm constantly worried about the pregnancy, worried about what I'm going to do, worried about money, worried about my parents' reaction... it's just a lot. Some nights I can't sleep because my brain won't shut off. And I know stress isn't good for the baby, but I can't really control it.\n\n*[She speaks more quietly]*\n\nI'm also still smoking, which I know is bad. I've cut back a little bit, but not much. And I'm not taking the prenatal vitamins they gave me information about. I just... I haven't gotten them filled or anything.\n\n*[She looks up at you, a bit defensively but also vulnerably]*\n\nI also had that concussion last year that's on my record. I don't know if that matters now that I'm pregnant? Nobody's really explained that to me.\n\nIs any of this... is this stuff I should be worried about?",

But that's not like, a prescribed medication or anything.\n\n*[She looks a bit guilty]*\n\nThe clinic gave me information about prenatal vitamins\u2014I think it was like a pamphlet or something\u2014and they said I should start taking them, especially folic acid because of like, brain development or whatever. But I haven't actually filled that prescription or gotten them yet. It's partly because I wasn't sure if I was going to keep the pregnancy, so I was like, \"why bother?\" But also just because... I don't know, I've never been great at remembering to take stuff regularly.\n\n*[She shifts uncomfortably]*\n\nI've dealt with anxiety for a while, like I mentioned, but I've never actually been prescribed anything for that. I just kind of... deal with it. My parents suggested I talk to someone about it, but without insurance, I didn't know how to make that happen or afford it.\n\n*[She looks at you with some concern]*\n\nShould I be taking something for the anxiety while I'm pregnant? Like, is that safe? And like, how important is the prenatal vitamin thing really? I know it's probably important, but I'm just... I'm not really on top of things right now.\n\n*[She pauses]*\n\nIs there anything else I should be taking that I don't know about?",

It's probably worse now than it was before I found out I was pregnant.\n\n*[She speaks somewhat defensively]*\n\nLike, money is tight, so I eat what's affordable and easy. A lot of like, ramen, cereal, sandwiches, fast food when I can afford it. My parents try to have decent meals at home, but I'm not always eating with them. I grab whatever's quick.\n\n*[She pauses, looking a bit uncomfortable]*\n\nSince I've been pregnant, the nausea has made it even harder. Like, some days I can't really stomach much of anything except like, crackers or ginger ale. Other days I'm starving and I'll eat whatever's available. There's not really a pattern.\n\n*[She looks down at her lap]*\n\nI know I'm probably supposed to be eating like, really healthy stuff\u2014vegetables and protein and all that. But honestly, I don't really know what I'm supposed to be eating specifically for pregnancy. Nobody's really gone through that with me in detail. The clinic gave me some paperwork, but it was kind of generic and didn't really account for like, my budget or what's actually available to me.\n\n*[She speaks more quietly]*\n\nI don't drink alcohol or anything, if that matters. And I try to drink water, but sometimes I just drink whatever's easiest\u2014soda, juice, whatever.\n\n*[She looks up at you]*\n\nIs my diet something I need to like, completely overhaul?

I get panic-y about stupid stuff.\n\n*[She pauses, speaking more vulnerably]*\n\nAnd then there's the uncertainty about what I actually want to do. Like, am I keeping this baby? Am I adopting it out?

I can't make a decision, so I'm just kind of stuck in limbo.\n\n*[She looks at you]*\n\nMy mom has been supportive, but I can tell she's worried about me. And that makes me feel worse.

Like, she was upset when I told her, but not in like, a mean way. She's worried, but she's also been like, \"we'll figure this out.\" She's offered to help with doctor's appointments, to come with me if I want. She's been asking if I need anything, checking in on how I'm feeling. She's stressed about money and everything, but she's still showing up for me.\n\n*[She pauses]*\n\nMy dad is... quieter about it.

He's worried, I can tell.\n\n*[She continues]*\n\nI have a couple friends I've told. One of them, my best friend Maya, has been really supportive.

I've done some part-time stuff\u2014babysitting, helping a neighbor with yard work, stuff like that\u2014but it's not consistent. Some months I might make like, a couple hundred dollars, and other months barely anything. My parents help cover my basic needs, but they're already struggling with their own bills and mortgage and everything.\n\n*[She wraps her arms around herself]*\n\nI don't have insurance, right? So like, I don't even know how much all of this is going to cost. The free clinic is helping with the prenatal stuff, which is good, but what about the actual birth? What if there are complications? What if I need to go to the hospital? I've heard that can be really expensive.\n\n*[She looks worried]*\n\nAnd then if I keep the baby... like, where would I even live? I can't stay with my parents forever. Babies need like, so much stuff\u2014cribs, car seats, formula, diapers. That's expensive. And I'd need childcare if I wanted to work or go back to school or anything.\n\n*[She speaks more quietly]*\n\nHonestly? That's part of why I'm so uncertain about keeping the pregnancy. Like, how am I supposed to afford to raise a baby when I can barely afford to take care of myself?\n\n*[She pauses]*\n\nMy mom has mentioned like, WIC and food stamps and stuff like that, but I don't really know how to apply for that or if I'd even qualify. And adoption... I don't know if that costs money or what that process even looks like.\n\n*[She looks at you, seeming overwhelmed]*\n\nHave you... do you know about resources for people in my situation? Like, financial help or assistance programs?",

      "text": "*[Olivia shifts in her seat, looking a bit uncomfortable]*\n\nWell, like I said, I don't really have like, a steady job right now. So in some ways, the pregnancy hasn't like, directly affected employment because I'm not employed in the traditional sense.\n\n*[She speaks more thoughtfully]*\n\nBut it's definitely made things harder in terms of like, finding work or being able to work. Like, the fatigue is real\u2014some days I'm so exhausted that I can barely get out of bed. And the nausea makes it hard to focus on anything. If I had a job right now, I don't know how I'd manage.\n\n*[She pauses]*\n\nI was thinking about maybe picking up more babysitting gigs or something to try to make some money before the baby comes\u2014if I'm keeping it. But honestly, I'm worried about like, the physical demands of that when I'm pregnant. And I don't know what I'm supposed to tell people. Like, do I tell them I'm pregnant? Do I hide it?\n\n*[She speaks more quietly]*\n\nMy mom has suggested that maybe I should think about like, going back to school or getting my GED or something, but that feels impossible right now. Like, how am I supposed to focus on school when I'm dealing with all of this?\n\n*[She looks down at her hands]*\n\nI think once I figure out what I'm doing with the pregnancy, I'll have a better sense of what I can do work-wise. But right now, it's just kind of... on hold, I guess.\n\n*[She looks up at you]*\n\nIs there like, job training or employment help for pregnant people? Or am I just kind of stuck in this limbo until I make a decision?",

Like, after the baby is born?\n\n*[She laughs nervously]*\n\nHonestly, I haven't thought that far ahead. Like, I'm still trying to figure out if I'm even going to have a baby, and you're asking me about what happens after...\n\n*[She pauses, collecting her thoughts]*\n\nI mean, I guess if I do keep the baby, I would... stay with my parents? At least for a while? My mom has mentioned that she could help with like, the first few weeks or whatever. But I don't really have a plan beyond that.\n\n*[She speaks more uncertainly]*\n\nLike, I know postpartum is like, a real thing that happens. I've heard it can be hard\u2014like, recovery and hormones and depression and stuff. But I haven't really looked into what that means or what I'd need to do to take care of myself during that time.\n\n*[She wraps her arms around herself]*\n\nAnd like, if I'm not working, how would I afford time off? And what about like, postpartum checkups? I don't even have regular prenatal care figured out, so I have no idea how that would work.\n\n*[She looks at you with a mix of anxiety and curiosity]*\n\nHonestly, the whole thing feels so far away and overwhelming that I kind of just... haven't let myself think about it. Is that something I should be planning for now? Like, even though I'm still unsure about the pregnancy itself?\n\n*[She hesitates]*\n\nWhat does postpartum care even involve?",

Like, I know I'm not doing everything right\u2014I'm not going to appointments, I'm still smoking, I haven't taken the vitamins. But talking about it made me think that maybe I should... I don't know, try harder or something.\n\n*[She pauses at the door]*\n\nDo you think... like, is there any chance you could send me information about those resources you mentioned? Like, the financial assistance stuff, or counseling, or like, reliable pregnancy information? Because I think I need to actually start taking this seriously, whether I keep the baby or not.\n\n*[She speaks more quietly]*\n\nAnd maybe I should call the clinic and schedule another appointment. Even if I'm still unsure about what I want to do, I should probably at least get checked out and talk to someone about the anxiety and the cramping and stuff, right?\n\n*[She looks at you with a mix of uncertainty and determination]*\n\nThank you again. This was... this was good. I needed this.\n\n*[She gives a small, tired smile before heading out]*\n\n---\n\n**[END OF INTERVIEW]**",
