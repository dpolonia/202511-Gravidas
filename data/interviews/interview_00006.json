It's not the best paying job, but it's what I've got right now. I don't have benefits or anything, so healthcare has been... honestly, it's been really stressful.\n\n*pauses and looks down*\n\nI'm living with my mom in Downey right now. She helps me out with my son\u2014he's almost 3 now\u2014which is huge because I don't know what I'd do without her. I'm single, so it's just me, my mom, and my kid in the house most days. My son's dad isn't really in the picture, which... yeah, that's been hard.\n\n*fidgets with hands*\n\nMoney is tight. Like, really tight. I make enough to cover some basics, but rent, childcare when I'm working, medical stuff\u2014it adds up fast. That's why I've been going to the free clinic for my checkups. The staff there are nice, but sometimes it's hard to get appointments when I need them.\n\n*looks up*\n\nI guess I should also mention\u2014I smoke, and I know that's not great, especially being pregnant again. I've tried to cut back, but... it's been a rough couple of years. I've been dealing with some depression too, but I haven't really gotten treatment for it. Just trying to get through each day, you know?\n\nIs there anything specific you want to know more about?",

I didn't even realize at first\u2014I just thought I was sick or something. When I finally took a test, I was already like two months along. I didn't tell anyone for a while because I was so anxious about what people would think, you know? But my mom was actually really supportive once I told her. She helped me through the whole thing.\n\n*pauses and rubs face*\n\nThat pregnancy was... it was hard. I didn't have good prenatal care because I was uninsured back then too. I went to the free clinic, but I missed a lot of appointments because of work or just not having a way to get there. I was smoking then too, which I feel really guilty about now. But I didn't know what else to do to cope with the stress.\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nMy son was born healthy, thankfully. I breastfed him for about three months, but then I had to go back to work and it just got too complicated with the schedule at the coffee shop.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nAnd now... I'm pregnant again. I found out about six weeks ago. I was using condoms, but apparently not perfectly, you know? *small nervous laugh* I wasn't planning this at all. I'm still figuring out how to take care of my son, and now there's going to be another baby.\n\n*looks at interviewer*\n\nHow far along am I now? I'm trying to remember... I think around 12 weeks or so? I haven't had my first official appointment at the free clinic yet for this pregnancy.",

I know, I know\u2014it's been six weeks since I found out, and I should probably be worried about that, but honestly, I've just been trying to wrap my head around it all.\n\n*fidgets with hands*\n\nI did call the free clinic about two weeks ago to try to schedule something. They said they could get me in, but the earliest appointment wasn't until like a month out. So I'm supposed to go next week, I think? I have it written down on my phone somewhere.\n\n*pulls out phone and scrolls*\n\nYeah, next Tuesday. I'm kind of nervous about it because... I don't know, I guess I'm worried they're going to judge me for smoking or for getting pregnant again so soon. And also, I'm not even sure what to expect. With my son, like I said, I missed a lot of appointments, so I don't really know what the normal process is supposed to be.\n\n*looks up*\n\nWith my first pregnancy, when I did go to the free clinic, the experience was... okay, I guess? The staff was nice enough, but it always felt rushed. Like, they'd see me for maybe 15 minutes, ask a few questions, take my blood pressure, and then I was done. I never really felt like I could ask questions or talk about what I was worried about.\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nAnd honestly, I was so young and scared the first time. I didn't even know what questions to ask. This time I'm a little older, but I'm also more tired, you know?

I don't have a regular doctor or anything like that\u2014I can't afford it, and I don't have insurance through work.\n\n*pauses*\n\nThe free clinic is... it's helpful, don't get me wrong. I'm grateful it exists because without it, I wouldn't have any healthcare at all. But it's not like I have one person I see every time. It's kind of whoever is available that day, you know? So I might see a different provider each visit. With my first pregnancy, I think I saw maybe three or four different people over the course of it.\n\n*looks up with a slightly frustrated expression*\n\nThat's actually one of the hardest parts, I think. You don't really build a relationship with anyone. Like, I have to re-explain my whole situation every time\u2014my living situation, my job, my depression, everything. And then by the time they understand where I'm coming from, the appointment is basically over.\n\n*rubs arms*\n\nI don't know the names of most of the providers I saw last time. They were nice, but it felt very... clinical? Like, they're checking boxes on a form rather than actually getting to know me or my concerns.\n\n*voice gets a bit anxious*\n\nI'm hoping this time will be different, but I'm not really expecting it to be. I'm just hoping whoever I see next Tuesday doesn't make me feel bad about the smoking or... you know, about not planning this pregnancy.\n\nDo most people have the same doctor for their whole pregnancy?",

And then more often as I got closer to my due date? But honestly, I missed so many appointments that I'm not totally sure. I'd say I probably made it to maybe... half of the appointments they scheduled for me? Sometimes I had to work, sometimes I just didn't have a ride, and sometimes I just... I don't know, I wasn't feeling up to it mentally.\n\n*describes with hand gestures*\n\nWhen I did go, a typical visit would be like... I'd check in at the front desk, wait maybe 20 or 30 minutes, then they'd take me back. They'd take my blood pressure, ask me how I was feeling, ask if I had any questions. Then they'd do an ultrasound maybe? Not every time though. And they'd listen to the baby's heartbeat with that little Doppler thing.\n\n*mimics the motion*\n\nThe whole thing was usually pretty quick\u2014like 15 to 20 minutes, maybe 30 if they had time. They'd give me some information sheets about nutrition or prenatal vitamins or whatever, and then I'd be out the door.\n\n*looks uncertain*\n\nI don't think I ever really got bloodwork done, or if I did, nobody explained what it was for.

It's happened twice now\u2014like a really painful sore throat, and I think it might have been viral or something? I didn't go to the clinic for it because I wasn't sure if I should be taking anything while pregnant, so I just... dealt with it. Drank a lot of tea, tried to rest when I could.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nAnd my gums have been bleeding when I brush my teeth. Like, more than usual. I mentioned it to my mom and she said it's probably just pregnancy hormones or something, but it's kind of gross and uncomfortable. I haven't been to a dentist in forever because, you know, no insurance and no money.\n\n*looks down*\n\nI also... I've been really tired. Like, exhausted all the time. And my mood has been pretty bad. I know I mentioned the depression thing\u2014I haven't been treated for it, and being pregnant again and stressed about money and everything... it's definitely gotten worse. Some days I just feel like I can't handle anything.\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nAnd honestly? I've been smoking more, not less, because I'm so anxious.

With my son, I think someone gave me a bottle at some point, but I don't remember taking them consistently. I was just... I didn't really understand why they were important, I guess.\n\n*rubs back of neck*\n\nAnd for the depression\u2014like I mentioned, I've never been on anything for that. I've never actually seen a therapist or psychiatrist or anything. I just kind of... cope on my own, you know? Smoke, try to distract myself with work or my son.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nThe sore throats I had, I didn't take anything for those because I wasn't sure what was safe during pregnancy.

But this time, I know what's coming, and it's terrifying.\n\n*counts on fingers*\n\nI need to think about diapers, formula\u2014I'm not planning to breastfeed this time because of work\u2014clothes, a crib, a car seat... all of that stuff is expensive. And I'm barely scraping by as it is with just my son.\n\n*voice gets anxious*\n\nMy paycheck at the coffee shop is like... it's minimum wage basically. After taxes, I'm taking home maybe $1,200 a month? And that has to cover my portion of rent, food, gas to get to work... My mom helps a lot, but I know she's struggling too. I can't ask her to pay for everything for another baby.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nI haven't bought anything yet for this pregnancy because I don't have the money. I'm hoping maybe I can get some stuff secondhand or that people will give me things like they did with my son. My mom's friends had some baby stuff they didn't need anymore.\n\n*looks down with guilt*\n\nAnd I'm worried about maternity leave. Like, I don't think I get paid leave at the coffee shop. So when I have the baby, I'm not going to be making money, but I still have bills to pay. How am I supposed to do that?\n\n*voice cracks slightly*\n\nI've heard about like, WIC and food stamps and stuff, but I don't really know how to apply or if I qualify. And honestly, I'm kind of embarrassed to ask for help.\n\n*looks up with concern*\n\nIs there financial help available for people like me? Because I'm genuinely not sure how I'm going to afford this.",

Like, I'm more tired than usual, my feet hurt more, and I'm feeling nauseous sometimes, especially in the mornings when I have to be there early.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nMy manager knows I'm pregnant now\u2014I had to tell him because I was worried about like, lifting heavy stuff or being around hot steam or whatever. He's been... okay about it, I guess? But I don't think he's thrilled. There's no formal maternity leave policy or anything, so I'm basically just hoping I can keep working as long as possible and then figure it out when the baby comes.\n\n*looks worried*\n\nThe problem is, I can't afford to take time off. Like, I need every paycheck. So I'm planning to work right up until I go into labor, which... I don't know if that's realistic or safe or what. With my son, I worked pretty far into the pregnancy too, and it was exhausting.\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nAnd I'm worried about what happens after the baby is born. I don't have paid leave, so I'm not getting paid while I'm recovering and taking care of a newborn. But I still have to pay rent and buy diapers and formula. My mom can help some, but...\n\n*trails off*\n\nI've thought about maybe trying to find a different job with better benefits, but honestly? I don't have the time or energy to job search right now. And with no college degree, my options are pretty limited anyway.\n\n*looks at interviewer with anxiety*\n\nHow long do you usually need to recover after giving birth? Like, could I realistically be back to work in like, two weeks?",

I guess I'll just figure it out like I did last time?\n\n*laughs nervously, but sounds anxious*\n\nWith my son, the postpartum period was really hard. I was bleeding a lot, my body hurt, I was exhausted, and I had no idea what was normal and what wasn't. My mom helped me a ton, but I remember feeling really alone and scared a lot of the time.\n\n*rubs arms*\n\nAnd the depression got worse after he was born, I think. Like, I was sad all the time, crying for no reason, not sleeping even when I had the chance. But I didn't know that wasn't normal, so I just... dealt with it. Nobody asked me about it or anything.\n\n*pauses, looking vulnerable*\n\nThis time, I'm honestly terrified it's going to be the same or worse. Like, I'm already depressed now, and adding a newborn and recovery on top of that... I don't know how I'm going to handle it.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nAs for practical stuff\u2014my mom is planning to help again. She'll probably take some time off work if she can, at least for the first couple weeks. She'll help with my son and the baby while I'm recovering. But after that, I don't know. I need to get back to work, and childcare for two kids is going to be... complicated and expensive.\n\n*voice gets quieter*\n\nI haven't thought about like, feeding the baby or anything specific. I'm not planning to breastfeed this time because of work, so I guess I'll do formula like I'm planning to. But I don't really know how to prepare for that or what I need.\n\n*looks down with concern*\n\nAnd like... postpartum depression or whatever. I don't know if I'm at risk for that or what I should do if it happens. Should I be talking to someone about this before the baby comes?\n\n*pauses*\n\nIs there stuff I should be planning for that I'm not thinking about?",
