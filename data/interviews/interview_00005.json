I really appreciate your willingness to participate in this research. \n\nBefore we dive in, I want you to know that this is a confidential conversation. There are no right or wrong answers\u2014I'm simply here to understand your experiences and perspectives on your healthcare, particularly around your pregnancy and prenatal care.\n\nI've reviewed some information about you already, but I'd like to hear directly from you about your journey. Let's start with something foundational:\n\n**Can you tell me a bit about how you're feeling right now, both physically and emotionally, as you're preparing for this pregnancy? How are you doing with all of this?**\n\n*[I'm settling in attentively, maintaining a warm and open demeanor, ready to listen carefully to your response]*",

This is actually my second pregnancy, so I have some experience with what to expect, which helps me feel a bit more prepared than I was the first time around.\n\nI'm an elementary school teacher\u2014I teach third grade\u2014so my days are pretty full and structured. I love what I do, even though it can be exhausting, especially now that I'm pregnant. I live here in rural North Carolina with my husband. We have a daughter from my first pregnancy, she's about four years old now, and we're excited about adding to our family.\n\n*pauses, fidgeting slightly with hands*\n\nLife is... it's busy. Teaching full-time while managing a household and now preparing for another baby keeps me on my toes. We're doing okay financially\u2014middle income, so we're not struggling, but we're not wealthy either. I have Medicare coverage, which I'm grateful for.\n\n*expression becomes more measured*\n\nI'm trying to stay healthy during this pregnancy. I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy, so I'm being really careful about that this time. I take my prenatal vitamins, keep up with my checkups. I'm moderately health-conscious\u2014I know what I need to do to take care of myself and my baby.\n\nIs there anything specific about my situation you'd like to know more about?",

That was... well, it was a learning experience, let's say. I didn't know as much about what to expect back then, and I wasn't as prepared as I am now.\n\n*touches abdomen gently*\n\nWith this pregnancy, I actually found out pretty recently\u2014I'd say about six weeks ago. I was planning this one, which is different from my first. My husband and I decided we wanted another child, so I was actually tracking things and being intentional about it. When I missed my period, I took a test at home, and it was positive. I was excited, but also... realistic, I guess. I knew what was ahead of me.\n\n*expression becomes more serious*\n\nThe thing about my first pregnancy was the gestational diabetes diagnosis. That was around 24 weeks if I remember correctly. It was stressful because I had to really monitor my diet and blood sugar levels, do all the testing. But I managed it well\u2014my doctor said I did everything right. My daughter was born healthy, and the gestational diabetes resolved after delivery.\n\n*pauses thoughtfully*\n\nThis time around, I'm already being proactive. My doctor mentioned I have some prediabetes findings, so we're watching that closely. I'm taking my prenatal vitamins, eating better, trying to stay active even though fatigue is hitting me hard right now.\n\nHow far along are you asking about, or do you want to know more about the gestational diabetes experience from last time?",

I think it was about two weeks after I got that positive test. I wanted to get established with care early this time, especially given my history with gestational diabetes.\n\n*settles back in chair*\n\nMy first appointment was with my OB-GYN here locally. I've been seeing the same doctor since my first pregnancy, so there's continuity there, which I appreciated. She knows my history, knows about the gestational diabetes, so we didn't have to start from scratch explaining everything.\n\n*expression becomes more nuanced*\n\nThe experience itself was... fine, medically speaking. They did all the standard things\u2014blood work, urine tests, dating ultrasound, medical history review. The staff was professional and efficient. We confirmed the due date, and they went over the prenatal vitamin recommendations and dietary guidelines.\n\n*pauses, choosing words carefully*\n\nBut I'll be honest\u2014accessing care out here in rural North Carolina isn't always the easiest. My doctor's office is about 30 minutes away, which isn't terrible, but it requires planning. I have to arrange coverage at school for appointments, coordinate with my husband sometimes for childcare for my daughter. It's manageable, but it adds complexity.\n\n*looks directly at interviewer*\n\nAnd there are definitely limitations in terms of specialists or additional resources if I need them. If complications arose, I'd likely need to travel further.\n\nWhat else would you like to know about my prenatal care experience so far?",

Like I mentioned, I've been seeing her since my first pregnancy, so we have an established relationship. That continuity has been really valuable for me.\n\n*expression softens*\n\nDr. Chen is competent and thorough. She listens to my concerns, takes my medical history seriously, and she's very aware of my gestational diabetes risk. She doesn't rush through appointments, which I appreciate. She explained everything clearly during my first prenatal visit this time around\u2014the screening tests, the timeline, what to expect.\n\n*pauses, considering*\n\nI'd say our relationship is professional but also... warm? She remembers details about my first pregnancy, asks about my daughter by name, which makes me feel like she actually cares, not just going through the motions. That matters to me.\n\n*fidgets slightly with hands*\n\nThat said, I think there are some limitations with rural healthcare. Dr. Chen is really the main option for obstetric care in our immediate area. If I needed a maternal-fetal medicine specialist or had high-risk complications, I'd have to travel to a larger city, which would be inconvenient and stressful.\n\n*looks thoughtful*\n\nI also see a nurse practitioner for some of my regular checkups between doctor visits, which helps with accessibility. She's knowledgeable and supportive too.\n\nOverall, I feel fortunate to have consistent care, but I'm aware that not everyone in my area has access to what I do. Do you have questions about what my care looks like day-to-day, or how I'm managing between appointments?",

Dr. Chen explained that as I progress through the pregnancy, the frequency will increase\u2014I think it becomes every two weeks in the third trimester, and then weekly toward the end. That's what happened with my first pregnancy anyway.\n\n*settles back, describing the routine*\n\nA typical visit is pretty straightforward, at least so far. I check in at the front desk, do the usual paperwork if there's anything new to update. Then I get called back, and they take my vital signs\u2014blood pressure, weight, temperature. The nurse also does a urine test each time to check for protein and glucose, given my history.\n\n*counts on fingers*\n\nThen I see Dr. Chen or the nurse practitioner. They ask how I'm feeling, if I have any concerns or symptoms. They listen to my blood pressure again, feel my abdomen, check the height of my uterus to make sure growth is on track. We talk about diet, exercise, any medications or supplements I'm taking.\n\n*expression becomes more serious*\n\nBecause of my prediabetes and previous gestational diabetes, there's definitely more focus on that. We talk about my diet pretty regularly\u2014what I'm eating, how I'm managing blood sugar. I know I'll be doing glucose screening again around 24 weeks, just like last time.\n\n*pauses thoughtfully*\n\nThe visits usually take about 30-45 minutes total. I haven't had an ultrasound since that first dating scan, but I know I'll have another anatomy scan around 20 weeks.\n\n*looks at interviewer*\n\nThe main challenge is just the logistics\u2014taking time off work, arranging childcare for my daughter, the drive. But the actual medical care feels solid so far.\n\nDoes that give you a good sense of what my routine looks like?",

I'm experiencing the typical first-trimester symptoms\u2014fatigue, some nausea, especially in the mornings. Nothing severe, but it's definitely there. I'm managing it okay.\n\n*pauses, choosing words carefully*\n\nThe main health concern right now is monitoring for gestational diabetes again. Dr. Chen and I are being very proactive about it because of my history. I'm already being more careful about my diet than I was early in my first pregnancy. I'm watching my carbohydrate intake, trying to eat more balanced meals. I haven't had my glucose screening yet\u2014that's coming up around 24 weeks\u2014but we're already discussing prevention strategies.\n\n*fidgets with hands slightly*\n\nI also have the prediabetes finding in my records, which adds another layer to that concern. So there's definitely some anxiety around whether I'll develop gestational diabetes again. It's not a complication yet, but it's something we're actively monitoring and trying to prevent.\n\n*expression becomes more guarded, voice quieter*\n\nBeyond the physical health stuff... there are other things that make pregnancy more complicated for me emotionally and psychologically.\n\n*pauses, seeming to weigh whether to continue*\n\nI'm... I'm dealing with some challenging personal circumstances that affect my overall wellbeing and stress levels. That impacts my health too, I think, even if it's not a medical complication in the traditional sense.\n\n*looks at interviewer with some vulnerability*\n\nWould you like me to talk about that?

I started those before I even got pregnant, actually, once my husband and I decided we wanted to try for another baby. I take them every morning with breakfast.\n\n*pauses thoughtfully*\n\nThat's really the main supplement I'm on right now. I don't take any prescription medications regularly. I had some minor issues with allergies and occasional headaches, but I'm being careful about over-the-counter medications during pregnancy. Dr. Chen cleared acetaminophen if I absolutely need it for a headache, but I'm trying to avoid even that when possible.\n\n*expression becomes slightly more guarded*\n\nI did have some antacids early in this pregnancy because of heartburn, which is common, I know. But again, I'm trying to manage it through diet modifications first.\n\n*looks directly at interviewer*\n\nWith my prediabetes and the gestational diabetes risk, we're not using any medications for that right now\u2014it's all dietary management and monitoring. If the glucose screening comes back concerning, that might change, but Dr. Chen wants to see if we can manage it through lifestyle first, which I appreciate.\n\n*settles back*\n\nSo really, just the prenatal vitamins as my main supplement.

Nutrition is something I'm really paying attention to this time around, especially given my gestational diabetes history.\n\n*leans forward slightly*\n\nI'm trying to eat a balanced diet with plenty of protein, vegetables, and whole grains. I've learned from my first pregnancy what works for my body. I'm being more intentional about avoiding foods that spike my blood sugar\u2014so I'm limiting refined carbohydrates, sugary snacks, things like that.\n\n*counts on fingers*\n\nA typical day for me might look like: oatmeal with berries and nuts for breakfast, a salad with grilled chicken for lunch, and something like baked salmon with roasted vegetables for dinner. I snack on things like Greek yogurt, cheese, nuts\u2014protein-focused snacks that keep me satisfied without causing blood sugar spikes.\n\n*pauses, expression becoming more thoughtful*\n\nI'm also drinking plenty of water. I know hydration is important during pregnancy, and it helps with managing cravings and energy levels too.\n\n*shifts slightly*\n\nThe challenge is that I'm teaching full-time, so I don't always have time to prepare ideal meals. Some days I'm grabbing what I can between classes. And honestly, the fatigue is real\u2014some evenings I'm relying on easier meals, though I try to keep them nutritious.\n\n*looks a bit concerned*\n\nI'm also conscious about weight gain. With my first pregnancy, I gained about 35 pounds, which my doctor said was healthy, but I want to be mindful this time. I'm trying to gain at a steady, appropriate pace rather than too much too quickly.\n\n*pauses*\n\nI'm not on any special diet, but I am tracking things more carefully than I did before.

There have been times when things have escalated in ways that are concerning.\n\n*looks down at hands*\n\nI know that's in my medical record\u2014the intimate partner abuse finding. It's not something I always disclose easily, but it's a reality I'm managing. And being pregnant makes it feel more urgent somehow, more frightening. I'm worried about how this will affect my baby. I'm worried about what kind of environment I'm bringing a child into.\n\n*voice wavers slightly*\n\nSo emotionally, I'm carrying a lot of anxiety and stress that goes beyond typical pregnancy worries.

      "text": "*settles back, expression becoming thoughtful but slightly strained*\n\nFinancially, we're... we're managing okay, but it's definitely something I think about.\n\n*pauses*\n\nWe're middle income\u2014my teaching salary is stable and decent, and my husband has work too, though honestly, I'm not always entirely clear on the details of his income situation. We have a mortgage, regular bills, childcare costs for my daughter. It's not tight, but we're not flush with extra money either.\n\n*fidgets slightly*\n\nThe good news is that I have Medicare coverage, which helps significantly with prenatal care and delivery costs. Without that, I think we'd be in a much more precarious position. My prenatal appointments, the ultrasounds, the lab work\u2014a lot of that is covered. That's a huge relief.\n\n*expression becomes more concerned*\n\nBut there are still out-of-pocket costs. There's the deductible, some services that aren't fully covered. We're budgeting for those. And then there's preparing for the baby itself\u2014we need to get the crib set up, buy diapers, formula if I can't breastfeed exclusively, baby clothes, all of that.\n\n*pauses thoughtfully*\n\nWith my first pregnancy, we had to buy a lot of baby gear from scratch. This time, we still have most of it\u2014the crib, car seat, stroller\u2014so that saves us money. But we'll need some new things, and costs add up.\n\n*shifts, voice becoming quieter*\n\nHonestly, the financial stress is compounded by uncertainty about my marriage. I worry about what happens if things don't work out\u2014what my financial situation would look like as a single mother. That's a background anxiety I carry.\n\n*looks directly at interviewer*\n\nMy parents have offered to help financially if we need it, which is reassuring but also something I'm reluctant to rely on. I want to feel like we can manage on our own.\n\n*pauses*\n\nWe're not in crisis mode financially, but I'm definitely conscious of costs and trying to be strategic about spending. Teaching doesn't pay lavishly, and while we're comfortable, we're not wealthy. So budgeting for a baby requires planning.\n\nIs financial stress something you're exploring in relation to maternal health outcomes?",

      "text": "*takes a deep breath, expression becoming more strained*\n\nOh, that's... that's actually been complicated. I'm trying to balance a lot right now.\n\n*shifts in seat*\n\nI'm still working full-time as a third-grade teacher, and I plan to continue working through most of my pregnancy. We need my income, and I also genuinely love what I do. My students keep me grounded and give me purpose, especially when other things feel chaotic.\n\n*pauses, rubbing temples*\n\nBut physically, it's getting harder. The fatigue in the first trimester is real\u2014I'm going home after school and basically collapsing. I'm trying to maintain my energy and enthusiasm for my students, but some days it's a struggle. By the end of the day, my feet hurt, I'm exhausted, and the commute home feels long.\n\n*expression becomes more concerned*\n\nI've had to be more intentional about self-care at work. I'm sitting down more during instruction, asking my teacher's aide for more support with physical tasks. I'm being careful about not overextending myself the way I normally might.\n\n*pauses thoughtfully*\n\nMy principal and colleagues have been relatively understanding. I haven't made a big announcement, but people know I'm pregnant. There's been some flexibility with things like bathroom breaks and not assigning me the most physically demanding tasks.\n\n*voice becomes quieter*\n\nThe bigger challenge is the stress. Teaching is inherently stressful\u2014managing 20+ eight-year-olds, lesson planning, grading, parent communication. Add pregnancy hormones and the emotional stress I'm dealing with at home, and some days I feel like I'm barely holding it together in the classroom.\n\n*looks concerned*\n\nI'm worried about taking maternity leave. I think I have about 12 weeks available through FMLA, but I'm not entirely certain about the details. Part of me wants to stay home longer with the baby, but financially that might not be feasible. We'd lose my income, and I'm not sure how we'd manage.\n\n*fidgets with hands*\n\nThere's also the question of childcare for my daughter while I'm on leave. That's going to be an expense and logistically complicated.\n\n*pauses, voice becoming more vulnerable*\n\nAnd honestly? There's a part of me that's relieved to have work as a place where I can be \"normal\" and away from the stress at home. Work is sometimes my escape. But that also means I'm not fully present at work because I'm carrying all this other stuff with me.\n\n*meets interviewer's eyes*\n\nI haven't talked to my employer about any of the personal stuff\u2014the intimate partner issues. I keep that completely separate. I show up, I do my job, I'm professional. But I'm definitely managing a lot.\n\n*takes a breath*\n\nSo to answer your question directly: my pregnancy hasn't caused me to leave work, but it's definitely affecting my capacity and energy level. And the stress in my personal life is making it harder to manage work effectively. It's all interconnected.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

There's so much uncertainty in my life that planning for postpartum feels premature in some ways.\n\n*fidgets with hands*\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, I know I'll have maternity leave\u2014about 12 weeks, I think, though I should probably verify those details with my HR department. I'm trying to figure out how we'll manage financially during that time. My salary will stop, which is significant for us.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nFor my daughter, my parents have offered to help with childcare while I'm recovering and adjusting to having a newborn. That's helpful, though it requires coordination. I'm hoping to breastfeed again, like I did with her, so I'll need to figure out pumping if I do go back to work before a year.\n\n*expression becomes more strained*\n\nPostpartum recovery itself\u2014I know what to expect physically from my first experience. The bleeding, the soreness, the hormonal changes. I'm prepared for that part. I'll follow up with Dr. Chen for my postpartum checkup around six weeks.\n\n*voice becomes quieter, more vulnerable*\n\nBut the emotional and relational side of postpartum... that's where I'm more anxious.\n\n*pauses, choosing words carefully*\n\nI struggled a bit with postpartum depression after my daughter was born. Nothing severe enough that I sought treatment, but I remember feeling overwhelmed, disconnected, anxious about whether I was doing things right. It took a few months to feel like myself again.\n\n*looks down at hands*\n\nThis time, I'm worried about that happening again\u2014especially given the stress I'm already under in my marriage. Postpartum is a vulnerable time, and I'm concerned about how my husband will be during that period. Will he be supportive? Or will the stress escalate?\n\n*voice becomes even quieter*\n\nI'm also thinking about... what if things don't improve in my marriage? What if the postpartum period is when I realize I need to make changes? I have two young children to consider. That's terrifying to think about.\n\n*takes a breath*\n\nI haven't really made concrete plans for postpartum mental health support, though I probably should. I know there are resources available, but I haven't accessed them. I'm hesitant to reach out, partly because I'm not sure how to explain what I'm dealing with.\n\n*meets interviewer's eyes*\n\nI'm also thinking about contraception after this baby. I don't think we want more children after this one. But that's a conversation I need to have with my husband, and honestly, those conversations feel risky right now.\n\n*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nSo to be direct: I'm not as prepared for the postpartum period as I probably should be. I have the practical logistics partially figured out, but the emotional and relational planning? That's murky and anxiety-inducing.\n\n*pauses*\n\nIs postpartum planning something you're specifically researching, or are you looking at the whole continuum of care?",

I know I should probably reach out for help\u2014whether that's counseling, a support group, or just more information about my options. I'm just... I'm taking it one day at a time right now.\n\n*stands up, extending hand*\n\nThank you again for this interview. I wish you well with your research.
