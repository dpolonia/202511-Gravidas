That visit was a lot more in-depth - they did a full physical exam, an ultrasound, and we went over my medical history in detail. \n\nThe OB team has been great at answering all my questions and making sure I understand what to expect throughout the pregnancy.

The doctor will also do an external exam and an ultrasound to check the baby's growth and position. She always takes the time to explain what she's seeing on the ultrasound screen and answer any questions I have.\n\nDepending on the stage of the pregnancy, they may also do additional tests or screenings at these visits.

My OB prescribed some anti-nausea medication that helped, but it was still a struggle for the first trimester.\n\nMore recently, I've been dealing with some issues related to gingivitis. My gums have been inflamed and bleeding more easily, even with good oral hygiene. The dentist said this is a common pregnancy-related condition. They've put me on a special mouthwash and recommended more frequent cleanings, but it's still an ongoing concern.\n\nAnd just a few weeks ago, I came down with a nasty case of viral sinusitis. The congestion and headaches were miserable. My OB was able to prescribe some safe medications to help, but it really knocked me down for a while.\n\nOverall, I feel like I've had a bit more than my fair share of health problems so far.

I try to only take it when I really need it, but it's been a lifesaver.\n\nFor the gingivitis, I'm using a special prescription mouthwash twice a day, as well as an antibiotic ointment that I apply to my gums.\n\nAnd most recently, the OB put me on a decongestant and cough suppressant to help with the viral sinusitis. I'm supposed to take those for a week or two until the infection clears up.\n\nI know it's a lot, but my OB has been very careful to make sure all the medications are safe for use during pregnancy.

But I tried my best to stick to simple, bland foods like crackers, rice, and bananas that were easier on my stomach.\n\nAs I've progressed through the pregnancy, I've been making more of an effort to incorporate a variety of healthy foods - lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy products. My OB recommended that I aim for around 300 extra calories per day to support the baby's growth.\n\nI've also been taking the prenatal vitamin religiously, as well as making sure I get enough folate, iron, and calcium in my diet. The nutritionist gave me some great meal planning tips and recipes to help make that easier.\n\nStaying hydrated has been important too. I try to drink plenty of water throughout the day, as well as some milk and juice. Cutting back on things like caffeine and processed foods has been an adjustment, but I know it's best for the baby.\n\nOverall, nutrition is something I'm very conscious of now.

I find myself constantly worrying about the baby and whether everything is progressing as it should.\n\nBut on the flip side, I also feel incredibly grateful and joyful about this pregnancy. My partner has been so supportive, and we're both really looking forward to becoming parents. Feeling the baby move for the first time was such a special, emotional moment.\n\nI've tried to be open with my OB about the emotional ups and downs.

I know it's important to take care of my mental health just as much as my physical health during this time.\n\nOverall, I'd say I'm managing the emotional aspects as best I can, but it's certainly been a challenge at times.

It's something we've discussed with my OB as well.\n\nInitially, I was really set on having a natural, unmedicated birth if possible. I'd read a lot about the benefits of avoiding interventions and allowing the process to unfold as naturally as it can. My OB was very supportive of that goal.\n\nHowever, as I've progressed through the pregnancy and dealt with some of the health issues, I've become a bit more open-minded. My OB has emphasized that the most important thing is the health and safety of both myself and the baby. So I'm trying to stay flexible and keep an open dialogue with my provider.\n\nAt this point, my main priorities are having a supportive, empathetic medical team, being able to move around freely during labor, and avoiding unnecessary interventions if possible. I'd love to be able to deliver in a birthing suite rather than a traditional hospital room. And I've expressed a strong preference for delayed cord clamping and immediate skin-to-skin contact after delivery.\n\nBut I also know that things don't always go according to plan, and I'm prepared to be adaptable if needed. My OB has assured me that they'll work closely with me to honor my wishes as much as they safely can. And of course, the most important thing is that the baby and I come through the experience healthy.\n\nIt's an ongoing discussion, but I feel good about the plan we've outlined so far.

Hearing different perspectives and experiences has helped me feel less alone in this process.\n\nIn terms of books, I've read a few highly-recommended pregnancy and childbirth guides that my OB suggested.
