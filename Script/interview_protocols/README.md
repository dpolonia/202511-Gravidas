## Creating Custom Protocols

To create your own interview protocol:

1. Copy an existing protocol as a template
2. Modify the metadata (name, description, etc.)
3. Update the questions array with your questions
4. Save with a descriptive filename (e.g., `gestational_diabetes.json`)

### Question Types

- **open-ended**: Free-form responses
- **structured**: Specific information requested
- **scale**: Rating or ranking (implement in interview logic)
- **yes-no**: Binary questions

### Best Practices

1. **Order questions logically**: Start broad, then specific
2. **Use clear language**: Avoid medical jargon
3. **Include follow-ups**: Help probe for details
4. **Be sensitive**: Especially for emotional topics
5. **Limit length**: 8-15 questions for most protocols
6. **Test first**: Run a few interviews to refine questions

## Usage

Run interviews with a specific protocol:

```bash
# Using prenatal care protocol
python scripts/04_conduct_interviews.py \
  --model claude \
  --protocol Script/interview_protocols/prenatal_care.json \

# Using pregnancy experience protocol
