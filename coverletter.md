## Dear Head of Department,

I am writing to request budget approval for a research project titled **"Scalable Synthetic Data Generation for Healthcare Service Operations: A Multi-Provider AI Cost-Optimization Framework"** with a total budget of €5,000 over a three-month period (January-March 2026).

According to the expense control report for Unit 2.24.300.14 (dated July 11, 2025), **€9,727.80 is currently available** across four budget areas, with no expenditures processed to date. The requested €5,000 represents **51.4% utilization**, maintaining fiscal prudence while securing significant research outcomes.

This project represents a significant opportunity for DEGEIT to establish leadership in the emerging field of AI service optimization for healthcare operations, with results targeted for publication in a Q1 management journal.

## 1. Project Overview

The Gravidas Synthetic Interview Pipeline project addresses a critical challenge in healthcare operations research: **the scarcity of realistic, privacy-compliant data for training AI systems and conducting service quality research**. Our solution combines:

- **Synthetic persona generation** using advanced AI models
- **FHIR-compliant health records** from validated generators
- **Semantic matching algorithms** for optimal data pairing
- **Multi-provider AI orchestration** to minimize costs while maintaining quality
- **Large-scale interview generation** (10,000 synthetic prenatal care interviews)

The project is currently operational with all six pipeline stages successfully tested. The GitHub repository (https://github.com/dpolonia/202511-Gravidas) demonstrates our technical readiness for the production phase.

| **Publication APC** | €2,800 | 56% | IJPE article processing charges (March) |
| **Infrastructure** | €50 | 1% | AWS cloud storage and database (3 months) |
| **TOTAL** | **€5,000** | **100%** | |

### 4.2 AI Execution Costs (€2,150)

**Multi-Provider Strategy:**

| Provider | Model | Cost/Interview | Interviews | Total Cost | Rationale |
|----------|-------|----------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Google Gemini** | 2.5 Flash | €0.009 | 5,793 | €1,245 | Primary: Best cost-effectiveness |
| **Anthropic Claude** | Haiku 4.5 | €0.12 | 2,975 | €639 | Quality validation & benchmarking |
| **xAI Grok** | Grok 4 Fast | €0.005 | 1,232 | €266 | Speed optimization |

**Cost Optimization Achievement:**
- Average cost per interview: **€0.215**
- Single-provider cost (Claude Sonnet): **€2.00/interview**
- **Cost reduction: 89.25%** (€20,000 → €2,150 for 10,000 interviews)

This multi-provider approach is **central to our research contribution**, demonstrating practical cost optimization while maintaining quality. Using a single provider would exceed the entire €5,000 budget for interviews alone.
